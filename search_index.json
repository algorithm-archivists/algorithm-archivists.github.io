If you would like to start work on one, get in contact with Leios first. If you create a full chapter, including text, and submit it as a pull request it is most likely going to get rejected.\nIf you want to help, it is best to write language examples for existing chapters. You can also try to find spelling or other mistakes in existing chapters and submit fixes for those.\n\nThe Arcane Algorithm Archive\nThe Arcane Algorithm Archive is a collaborative effort to create a guide for all important algorithms in all languages.\nThis goal is obviously too ambitious for a book of any size, but it is a great project to learn from and work on and will hopefully become an incredible resource for programmers in the future.\nThe book can be found here: https://www.algorithm-archive.org/.\nThe GitHub repository can be found here: https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive.\nMost algorithms have been covered on the YouTube channel LeiosOS: https://www.youtube.com/user/LeiosOS\nand live coded on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/simuleios.\nIf you would like to communicate more directly, please feel free to go to our discord: https://discord.gg/Pr2E9S6.\nNote that the this project is essentially a book about algorithms collaboratively written by an online community.\nFortunately, there are a lot of algorithms out there, which means that there is a lot of content material available.\nUnfortunately, this means that we will probably never cover every algorithm ever created and instead need to focus on what the community sees as useful and necessary.\nThat said, we'll still cover a few algorithms for fun that have very little, if any practical purpose.\nIf you would like to contribute, feel free to go to any chapter with code associated with it and implement that algorithm in your favorite language,\nand then submit the code via pull request, following the submission guidelines found in contents/how_to_contribute/how_to_contribute.md (or here if you are reading this on gitbook).\nHopefully, this project will grow and allow individuals to learn about and try their hand at implementing different algorithms for fun and (potentially) useful projects.\nIf nothing else, it will be an enjoyable adventure for our community.\nThanks for reading and let me know if there's anything wrong or if you want to see something implemented in the future!\n\nLicense\nThe content of this project itself is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (link below).

I for one, have never been able to follow a lecture. No matter how interesting the subject might be, the teacher or professor either moves too slowly or too quickly, and in both cases I lose the motivation to study and learn outside of class. Looking back at all my past lectures, this is a bit of a shame. I genuinely love learning! In fact, nowadays there's nothing I enjoy more than poring through the ArXiv, looking for the latest and greatest algorithms in physics and computer science. Sure, I cannot understand them all, but sometimes it's nice to be completely overwhelmed and chip away at problems one piece at a time. In the end, modern research is a conglomeration of fun little (or big) puzzles to solve; however, I find that many papers are too harsh for most people to tackle without a significant background in computer science or physics. For this reason, they are ignored by the public. We live in an era where nearly the entire sum of human knowledge is available at our fingertips, and yet people are blissfully unaware of the unique ideas and challenges that are pushing our understanding forward.\nI guess that is the point of this work. Throughout the past few years, I have been collecting small morsels of knowledge that are hard to express in any meaningful way through blog posts, YouTube, or twitch streaming. YouTube, for example, is a great place to introduce the general idea of an algorithm; however, I personally find it a poor choice to show a worked example. Twitch is great to show everything, but spending 5 hours programming up an algorithm for the first time is generally not everyone's idea of fun. Blog posts work well for this type of material; however, they lack a comprehensive nature that I tend to enjoy. So what's left? Well, I suppose that would be a book, which is an incredibly exciting prospect!\nSee, when I was younger, maybe around Jr. High School age, I really wanted to become an author. I spent as much free time as I could manage writing fantastical stories about heroes and villains creating their own worlds and redefining reality. It was (and still is) an enjoyable hobby of mine. In many ways, my love of storytelling is echoed in my love of science and mathematics. In my mind, every discovery is its own story -- an adventure just waiting to be understood! It seems incredible to me that I now have the chance to combine my two favorite hobbies: writing and learning.\nNow, to be clear, I am not a master computer scientist. In fact, my degree is in physics and at the time of writing, I am in a PhD program studying quantum systems; however, I really, really love learning algorithms. About a year or two ago, I started a Twitch stream focused on computational physics. Almost every day, I would get up at 5:00AM and livecode something I had never coded before. It was incredibly fun and through working with the community, we learned a lot. In addition, I found my programming abilities improving significantly, and I learned to see the power in a community of hobby programmers.\nThis text is a natural extension of that idea -- a community effort to learn as much as possible about as many algorithms as we can. Because of this, I feel like I should be as honest as possible about the nature of this book. As mentioned, I am not classically trained in computer science, so for the most part, I will be learning right along with you, the reader. My hope is to advance my own understanding of computer science while also providing a comprehensive guide for those wishing to improve their own understanding as well.\nFor this reason, I hesitate to call this a work a \"textbook\" and would prefer to think of it as a lab notebook of sorts. It will be an archive filled with cool ideas in computer science and physics that I hope will be interesting in their own right. My hope is that this book perfectly straddles the line between comprehensiveness and pleasure and will be an enjoyable read for anyone at any stage on their hobby programming journey.\nKeeping with the community theme, this book is freely available on github and GitHub pages. Please feel free to read / browse the content available there. If you have any questions / comments / concerns, please let me know. This book is a community project and will only work if there is a community that works on it!\nAs a final note before beginning the bulk text, I would like for this book to be \"language agnostic.\" This basically means that I would like to use psuedocode in the main text, but provide source code in any language you could want in the appendix. Though this may seem a little counter-intuitive, I think it offers the greatest flexibility for myself as the author and for the community to develop their own code in any way they please. In fact, if you feel inclined, please feel free to implement your own version of any algorithm mentioned in this text. If you submit it and it passes all my ahem rigorous tests, then I can throw it at the end of each chapter with attribution to you!\nSo I guess that's all for now. Because this book is freely available online, I may be heavily modifying the content as we delve deeper into the archive of arcane algorithms.\n"},"contents/how_to_contribute/how_to_contribute.html":{"url":"contents/how_to_contribute/how_to_contribute.html","title":"How To Contribute","keywords":"","body":"How to Contribute to the Algorithm Archive\nThe Algorithm Archive is an effort to learn about and teach algorithms as a community.\nAs such, it requires a certain level of trust between community members.\nFor the most part, the collaboration can be done via GitHub and gitbook, so it is important to understand the basics of version control.\nIdeally, all code provided by the community will be submitted via pull requests and discussed accordingly; however, I understand that many individuals are new to collaborative projects, so I will allow submissions by other means (comments, tweets, etc...).\nAs this project grows in size, it will be harder and harder to facilitate these submissions.\nIn addition, by submitting in any way other than pull requests, I cannot guarantee I will be able to list you as a collaborator (though I will certainly do my best to update the CONTRIBUTORS.md file accordingly).\nAt this point, I am trying to figure out the best way to balance community contributions and text.\nRight now, I feel comfortable writing the text associated with each algorithm and asking for the community to write individual implementations.\nIn the future, I might allow other users to write algorithm chapters, but for now let's keep it simple: I'll do the writing, everyone else does the coding.\nNow for some specifics on submissions:\n\nStyle: Follow standard style guidelines associated with your language of choice. For C / C++, please use Stroustrup style, with auto used rarely or not at all. We have had plenty of discussions about this, which can be found here. I will leave the issue open for now in the case that other individuals have more to contribute there. Basically, your code should be readable and understandable to anyone -- especially those who are new to the language. In addition, remember that your code will be displayed in this book, so try to keep to around 80 columns and try to remove any visual clutter. In addition, keep variable names clean and understandable.\nLicensing: All the code from this project will be under the MIT license found in LICENSE.md; however, the text will be under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.\nCONTRIBUTORS.md: After contributing code, please echo your name to the end of CONTRIBUTORS.md with echo name >> CONTRIBUTORS.md, and also leave a comment on the top of the code you submitted with your name (or username) saying // submitted by name. This way everyone is held accountable and we know who to contact if we want more information.\nBuilding the Algorithm Archive: If you want to build the Algorithm Archive on your own machine, install gitbook and use gitbook serve in the main directory (where README.md is). This will provide a local URL to go to to view the archive in your browser of choice. Use this server to make sure your version of the Algorithm Archive works cleanly for the chapter you are updating!\n\nFor this project, we allow submissions in every language.\nTo submit code, simply go to the code directory of whatever chapter you want and add a directory for your language of choice.\nWe use two gitbook plugins to allow users to flip between languages on different algorithms.\nOne is the theme-api, and the other is the include-codeblock api.\nWe need the following statements in the markdown file for these to work together:\n{% method %}\n{% sample lang=\"jl\" %}\n[import:1-17, lang:\"julia\"](code/julia/conv.jl)\n{% endmethod %}\n\nFor this example, we are starting the theme-api method and importing lines 1-17 from a sample Julia snippet from the code directory.\nNote that to standardize the language capitalization schemes, we ask that each language's sample lang is the file extension for their code, cpp for C++, hs for Haskell, etc...\nThis keeps the title in the theme-api consistent across different languages.\nAlso note that depending on the algorithm, there might be in-text code snippets that also need to be written.\nI'll update this page as the project grows. Basically, when you submit code, it will be under an MIT license. Please keep the code clean and put your name (or username) in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.\nIf you would like to be a part of the ongoing discussion, please feel free to join our discord server: https://discord.gg/pb976sY.\nThanks for all the support and considering contributing to the Algorithm Archive!\n"},"contents/git_and_version_control/git_and_version_control.html":{"url":"contents/git_and_version_control/git_and_version_control.html","title":"Version Control","keywords":"","body":"Git and Version Control\nI am a fan of open-source software. It allows users to see inside the code running on their system and mess around with it if they like.\nUnlike proprietary software, open source software allows any user to learn the entire codebase from the ground up, and that's an incredibly exciting prospect!\nMore than that, open-source development breeds strong communities of like-minded individuals who work together to solve problems they care about.\nAt least in my case, different open-source communites inspired me to code in my free time.\nIt taught me that programming is more than a simple series of instructions for a computer.\nMore than anything, though, open-source software development taught me about how to work with others and overcome petty squabbles, because if there's one thing any open-source community is known for, it's petty squabbling.\nIt might be because of my appreciation of large-scale software development that I never questioned the utility of version control.\nIf there are a couple hundred people all contributing source code to the same place, there has to be some way to control all the different codebases each individual has on their own machine.\nEven if I have no collaborators, version control is a way to make sure my laptop and work machine both have the same code without having to transer a USB stick back and forth.\nThat said, at some point in my life, I became a physics researcher.\nThis meant that I wrote code to solve physics problems with a small team. The problem was that even though I was using version control, the rest of my team was not.\nThis was frustrating.\nI would hear my labmates say things like, \"I rewrote my code last night and now nothing works, but I already saved over my previous version, so I'll just work with what I have.\"\nOr, \"I'm writing a paper with my boss. We are using Dropbox and upload files with slightly different names after we modify them. Right now, we are on paper_78c.\"\nThe point is: version control exists to control different versions of software (and other documents).\nIf you are writing code, it exists as a way to quickly save what you have before making largescale modifications.\nIt also allows individuals to collaborate on a larger scale by providing necessary tools to merge work created by different individuals into a single, cohesive story.\nNo matter how you look at it, version control is a useful and necessary tool to collaborate with other programmers and is definitely worth discussing in depth.\nThough many version control systems exist, for now we will focus on git, simply because it is incredibly popular and this book is hosted both on github and gitbook.\nWe hope to discuss other version control methods and strengthen this tutorial on git in the future; however, this book is meant as an archive of algorithms, not as an introduction to version control or best software practices.\nThough discussions like these are useful, we must be careful not to get too far out-of-scope.\nFor now, this tutorial is simply meant as a quick way to kickstart our community into using git and collaborating more effectively with each other (specifically on this book).\nI feel like this introduction may have been a little too long. Let me know what you think! Regardless, now it's time to talk about git!\nGitting started!\nI suppose let's start simply: git manages different versions of code available on different machines and from different locations.\nWhen using git, there will be a local copy of a repository of code that may or may not be up-to-date with a copy of the code repository in some remote location.\nNow, there is an easy way, a hard way, and an impossibly complicated way to use git.\nWe'll be walking through the easy and hard ways.\nWe are not trying to impress anyone with git wizardry. We are simply trying to provide the basics with a little undersanding sprinkled in.\nAs a side note: we will be assuming that you are using git from the terminal. There is a GUI available from github and it works super well for most cases; however, it's also self-explanatory in most cases.\nPut another way: if you can understand the ways of the terminal, the git GUI will be much more straightforward. On the other hand, learning the GUI will not necessarily help you when using the terminal.\nSo, first things first. Make sure git is installed on your system and set it up with the following commands\ngit config --global user.name name\ngit config --global user.email name@email.com\nObviously, use your own name and e-mail... unless your name is actually name and your e-mail is actually name@email.com, in which case the above commands are correct.\nIn the rare case that a user named \"name\" with the e-mail \"name@email.com\" is reading this, I apologize for spoiling your anonymity.\nFor everyone else, remember that git is meant to facilitate collaborative code development, so we need to know who is submitting code so we can communicate more effectively later.\nThat said, it is alright to use a username and e-mail address that does not spoil your identity in the real world, so long as you are reachable by the information provided.\nFinding some code\nNow we need to find a repository of code to work on. If you are starting your own repository or want to work on an internal network, this will not be too big of an issue.\nIf you just want to get the feel for how git works, I suggest going to github.com and checking out the code developed there.\nNote that you will not be able to contribute to any old directory on github, simply because if anyone could contribute any code they wanted to any repository they wanted, the world would become incredibly chaotic.\nBecause of this, you may want to create a repository under your own github username or make your own copy of someone elses code on github by clicking the fork button:\n\n    \n\n\nNote that if you have a fork of a particular code repository, you can ask the owner of the original code repository to pull your changes into their version of the code with a pull request, but we are getting ahead of ourselves here.\nIf you cannot think of what repository to work on and want to collaborate on this project in the future, feel free to fork the Algorithm Archive and modify that!\nRegardless, as long as there is a repository under your username on github, we can continue by linking that remote github location to your local git directory. First, we need to find the url of the github repository, as shown here:\n\n    \n\n\nNote that there are 2 provided urls here, one for ssh and another for https. From the user's perspective, the difference between the two is minimal: ssh requires the user to type only a password when interacting with the remote github repository, while https requires both a username and password.\nNow, you will probably be interacting with github a lot, so ssh will definitely save time and is preferred for many people who use git a lot; however, there is some initial set-up.\nIf you want, we can discuss the set-up in more detail later (just let me know!), but for now, we'll stick with https because it's more familiar to new users.\nOnce you have the url, there are 2 ways to proceed:\nThe easy way:\ngit clone https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive\nThe not-so-easy way:\nmkdir algorithm_archive\ncd algorithm_archive\ngit init\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive\ngit fetch\ngit merge origin/master\nHere, git clone does every step of the not-so-easy way in one command, so the two methods are completely identical. Because of this, in most cases, I just use git clone; however, the not-so-easy way is much more explicit and helps us understand what is going on a little better.\nFor now, we will breifly describe each of the commands; however, we will definitely be covering them in more depth through this tutorial.\nSo, here it is, step-by-step:\n\nmkdir algorithm_archive: make a directory. We can call this directory anything, but we'll call it algorithm_archive for now.\ngit init: initialize git\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive: add a remote location (the github url we found just a second ago). Again, we can call this remote location anything, but git clone always calls it origin, so well stick with that.\ngit fetch: update the local directory with the information from the remote online repository\ngit merge origin/master: merge those updates. Right now, the origin/master part of this command might seem like a bit of black octocat magic, but we will cover it in just a bit!\n\nNo matter how you initialize your git repository, your local directory will be linked with a remote location. If you ever want to see this location, simply type:\ngit remote -v\norigin    https://github.com/user/algorithm-archive.git (fetch)\norigin    https://github.com/user/algorithm-archive.git (push)\nThis provides information on different remotes. We'll talk about fetch and push a bit later.\nNow, you might be asking yourself: If I am only connected to the url I forked earlier, what happens when the owner of the main code repository pushes changes? How will I update my code when this happens?\nActually, you probably were not asking that question. It's not an obvious question to ask at all, but it's a useful question to move this tutorial forward.\nThe solution is simple: Add another remote like so:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive\nObviously, you can call the remote anything. I kinda arbitrarily chose to call it upstream. By adding this in, you can easily interact with the same codebase from multiple remote locations.\nThat said, we need to talk about how to do that.\nCommitting to git\nNow you have the repository linked to another online source. Note that you are not authorized to push changes onto the upstream url, but that's alright for now. Let's just stick to modifying origin.\nAt this point, we can make any modification we want! I might suggest doing something simple:\necho name >> CONTRIBUTORS.md\nNothing crazy, just something so we can get the feeling of git. To see what files have been changed, type:\ngit status\nThis will show that CONTRIBUTORS.md has been modified.\nIf we want to save our changes, we need to add all of the files with changes to them to a package called a commit.\nTo add the files, simply type:\ngit add CONTRIBUTORS.md\nThen if we type git status again, it will show that the file CONTRIBUTORS.md is in a staging area awaiting commit.\nThis simply means that git is waiting to make sure there are no other changes we want to package up.\nNow we create the commit by typing\ngit commit -m \"Adding name to contributors file\"\nNote that if you do not use the -m message flag (just git commit), git will open your default editor (probably vi) to ask for a message.\nEvery git commit needs a git message! Make the messages count.\nBe as descriptive as possible!\nIf you want to see all commits that have ever been made on this repository, simply type\ngit log\nThis will show you the history so far. As a side note, it also shows why good, clean commit messages are essential to managing large, open-source projects.\nIf there are hundreds (or thousands) of commits, and one of the features implemented somewhere down the line has a bug, clean commit messages allow us to find when that feature was implemented and possibly when the bug arose.\nNow let's say you want to checkout what the code looked like at a particular commit. To do this, we need to look at the generated unique string (SHA-1 checksum) associated with the commit we want and paste the first few (roughly 5) characters into the following command:\ngit checkout CHARS\nIt's incredibly unlikely that any two commits will share the first n characters, so this is unique enough for git to identify which commit we were referring to and send us back there, but here's where the notation get's a little crazy!\nSee, when we are sent back in time to the chosen commit (with the above command), we will be in a detached head state.\nThis refers to the term we use to describe the very latest commit, HEAD.\nIf we wanted to checkout the previous commit (for example), we would use git checkout HEAD~1, the second-to-last commit would be HEAD~2, and so on and so-forth.\nWhen we checkout another commit, we are rolling the head of our commitment snake back to what it was in the past.\nIn the detached head state, we shouldn't really do any development. It's more of a read-only type of thing; however, if we want to develop the code starting at that commit, we could use\ngit checkout -b CHARS\nBut this requires a little explanation!\nCheckout these branches!\nNow let's take a step to the side and talk about another fantastic git feature, branches.\nAt this point, we might have code forked under our own username on github. This means that there could be at least 2 functioning versions of the code we are working on: our own fork and the original owner's fork.\nThat said, within each fork, there is the ability to have multiple lines of development, each one on a different branch.\nIf you are new to software development, this might not seem too useful; however, imagine you are working on a large, open-source project that thousands of people use.\nAt some point, you might want to re-organize a bunch of features in the code.\nAs a developer, you might not be sure whether all the features you are re-organizing will still work properly after re-organizing them, but you know the code needs to be modified!\nThe problem is that you have users who may need the features you might accidentally break.\nFor this reason, you might want to have a \"master\" branch -- one that is always working for the users, and a \"development\" branch -- one that is in the middle of creating new features for users.\nIn truth, there are dozens of reasons why developers might want to work on slightly different versions of the code.\nRather than spending time outlining all the potential reasons, let's just dive into how branches are made and maintained.\nTo check which branch you are on, simply type:\ngit branch\nThis will show you your currently active branch. If you haven't switched branches yet, you will probably by on master.\nTo switch branches, use\ngit checkout branch\nAnd this will change all of the files on your local directory to match the branch you have swapped to.\nNote that if you have local changes that will be overwritten when changing branches, git will note these changes and tell you to do something about them before switching to a new branch.\nIf you want to get rid of the changes, you could delete any files that are causing conflicts; however, this is barbaric and should be avoided in civilized society.\nAnother solution is to use a feature of git called the stash.\nIn many ways, this is much easier to do than deleting files manually. All you need to do is type:\ngit stash\nThis will stash all the local changes and bring the directory back to the latest HEAD. If you want to get your changes back, just use\ngit stash apply\nNow, here's the problem: because git stash is so convenient, I tend to have the habit of stashing local changes quite often. This means that I have multiple modifications stored, all connected to different commits.\nQuite frankly, it's a mess. That said, I can list out everything in my stash with\ngit stash list\nand apply whichever stash I want with\ngit apply stash@{i}\nWhere i is the value of the stash item I want to apply.\nNow, to be clear: I am not encouraging anyone to use git stash to hide away local changes and make branch traversal easier; however, if you are about to delete files, maybe try git stash instead?\nFinally, we need to talk about a super sticky part of git: merging branches.\nFollowing from the story above, you might have code in a development branch.\nWhen you are happy with the changes in the development branch, you might want to merge those changes back to the master branch.\nAssuming that no one was developing on the master branch and that the development branch is ahead of the master branch, this can be done with the following:\ngit checkout master\ngit merge branch\nThis is the simplest case, but it's rarely this simple. Often times, there will be development on different branches and when we merge these brances together, there will be conflicts.\nThese conflicts are noted in each of the files that need to be modified like so\nI am writing about\n>>>>>> development\nHere, we wrote the phrase: \"I am writing about things\" on the master branch and \"I am writing about stuff\" on the development branch. Git got confused and let us know it has no idea what's going on.\nTo solve this, we will need to manually go through and find all the conflicts noted in the git status command and fix them to what they should be.\nThe easiest way to do this (in my opinion) can be found here: https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/.\nNote that there are a lot of good tools for this and everyone has their favorite choice.\nI don't expect for too many users to run into merge conflicts while working with the Algorithm Archive, so I will omit much more discussion here, but let me know if you think I should cover this in more detail.\nIt's an incredibly difficult aspect of using git and will drive you nuts the first tie you see it, but after that, it will be much more straightforward.\nAlso: let me know if there's any tools you like, and I'll add them to this guide here.\nInteracting with github\nTo this point, we have introduced the concept of remotes and how to set them up, but we have not discussed how to interact with them.\nFor the most part, there are only a few commands to keep in mind. the easiest one to explain is\ngit push\nAfter we have made a commit (discussed above), we can push it to github like so\ngit push remote branch\nFor example, if you are pushing the master branch to the origin remote, it would be\ngit push origin master\nNow, I personally like being explicit about which branch and remote we are working with, but you can tell git to ignore the remote and branch specifications by setting an upstream url, which means running\ngit push -u remote branch\nOnce this is run, the remote and branch will be stored for later and you won't need to think about it ever again! (Well, you might need to think about it when working on more complicated things later)\nNow, if pushing moves changes from your own computer to a repository online, it would make sense that pulling does the opposite and moves changes from an online repository to your machine. Like before, this is straightforward:\ngit pull remote branch\nHowever, there's a little more to it than that. In essense, git pull is running two separate commands. One updates your git repository with the information found on your remotes. This one is called git fetch.\nThe other one finds the changes and merges those changes with the branch found on your local machine. This is called git merge (as discussed before). When put together, it might look like:\ngit fetch\ngit merge origin/master\nFor now, I think that's all you will need: git pull and git push.\nNow let's talk about something that will certainly happen in your programming career: mistakes.\nDealing with mistakes\nI cannot help with programming mistakes (typos and such), but when it comes to version control there are two times during which mistakes can be made: before a commit and after a commit.\nEach of these have a different solution and have different repercussions depending on how you want to proceed with code development.\nNote that these solutions can be quite complicated and may easily move beyond the scope of this text.\nBecause of this, I will link to appropriate documentation as necessary.\nFirstly, let's talk about what happens when you make a mistake while your code is in the staging area, awaiting a commit.\nHere, the solution is simple:\ngit reset\nThat's it. Don't overcomplicate it. You haven't committed to the code yet, so just unstage everything back to the HEAD.\nThe problem is that this command is quite nuanced and has plenty of other uses. This goes beyong the scope of this text, but you can find more information here: https://git-scm.com/blog.\nNow, what if your mistake was found after committing? Well, that's a little more complicated. Your mistake is already in your git log.\nThe easiest way to deal with this is to live with the mistake and make a new commit that fixes it later.\nOne way to reverse the commit completely is with\ngit revert commit\nwhere commit is whatever commit you want to undo from your git log.\nAssuming you are working with a small team and don't mind having a somewhat dirty commit history where your mistakes haunt you forever in your git log, this is fine; however, if you want to remove the commit completely, you might need to think about using another command:\ngit rebase\nthe problem is that git rebase is complicated and could potentially destroy your codebase if it's used inappropriately.\nBecause of this, I often just live with my mistakes; however, in rare cases, having a clean git log is incredibly important.\nI am not a git magician (yet), so I will not delve into what is essentially black magic to me. Instead, I'll link a guide: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing.\nI know that this section is a little sparse and there's a lot I missed.\nIf you want to provide more information, feel free to do so and submit it via pull request.\nConcepts we missed\nUnfortunately, this discussion has a scope. It is not meant to give you a deep, meaningful understanding of git.\nInstead, we focused on the basics, with the hope of encouraging our community to start collaborating together.\nThe more you use git, the easier it will be to use in the future and the more it will start to make sense.\nThat said, due to the nature of this guide, there were a few things we missed, the two most important of which are rebasing and merge conflicts.\nIn addition, I need to be honest in saying that I am not the most qualified person to teach anyone how to use git or version control and that there are plenty of good guides out there already, so if you have any guides that you like, please let me know and I can add them to the end of this guide for more information.\n"},"contents/data_structures/data_structures.html":{"url":"contents/data_structures/data_structures.html","title":"Data Structures","keywords":"","body":"Data Structures\nThis is a book about algorithms.\nThe fundamental building blocks of algorithms are data structures, and thus as more algorithms are added to the Archive, more data structures will be added to this section.\n"},"contents/stacks_and_queues/stacks_and_queues.html":{"url":"contents/stacks_and_queues/stacks_and_queues.html","title":"Stacks and Queues","keywords":"","body":"Stacks and Queues\nStacks and Queues are two sides of the same coin in computer science. They are both simple data structures that hold multiple elements, but allow you to use a single element at a time. The biggest difference between the two structures is the order in which you can access the elements in the data structure.\nIn stacks, data follows Last In, First Out (LIFO), which basically means that whichever element you put in last will be the first element you take out. It acts exactly like a stack in real life. If you put a book on a stack of other books, the first book you will look at when sifting through the stack will be the book you just put on the stack.\nIn Queues, data follows First In, First Out (FIFO), which means that whichever element you put in first will be the first element you take out. Imagine a queue of people. It would be unfair if the first person in line for groceries were not the first person to receive attention once the attendant finally shows up.\nFor the most part, though, queues and stacks are treated the same way. There must be a way to:\n\nlook at the first element (top())\nto remove the first element (pop())\nto push elements onto the data structure (push())\n\nThe notation for this depends on the language you are using. Queues, for example, will often use dequeue() instead of pop() and front() instead of top(). You will see the language-specific details in the source code under the algorithms in this book, so for now it's simply important to know what stacks and queues are and how to access elements held within them.\n"},"contents/mathematical_background/mathematical_background.html":{"url":"contents/mathematical_background/mathematical_background.html","title":"Mathematical Background","keywords":"","body":"Mathematical Background\nNo matter who you ask, programming requires at least a little math.\nThat said, for most programmers, it doesn't require too much.\nFor the most part, depending on your specialty, you will probably not see too much calculus or differential equations.\nHonestly, you could probably get away with what you learned in high school.\nHowever, this is a book about algorithms, and algorithms sometimes require a deeper understanding of mathematics.\nThis section attemps to provide the mathematical foundations that you will need to understand certain algorithms.\nAs we add new algorithms and need new mathematical tools, we will add them to this section.\nA notable exception to this rule will be in the case of classes of algorithms that require domain-specific knowledge, like quantum simulations or bioinformatics.\nIn those cases, we will place the mathematical methods in more relevant sections.\n"},"contents/notation/notation.html":{"url":"contents/notation/notation.html","title":"Complexity Notation","keywords":"","body":"Complexity Notation\nAlgorithms are designed to solve problems.\nOver time, new algorithms are created to solve problems that old algorithms have already solved.\nIn some cases, the new algorithms are not intrinsically better than the older ones.\nIn other cases, these new algorithms breathe life into areas of research and engineering that could not exist without them.\nThe question is: what makes an algorithm \"better\" than another one?\nObviously, there is no good answer to this question.\nIf you write an algorithm to solve a problem, whatever you come up with will probably work just fine for small problems.\nThat said, if you need to use the algorithm for a larger system, you might find yourself waiting for longer and longer on your code to run.\nIn these cases, it's obvious that if you are working on a large system, you need an algorithm that scales well with a large size.\nIdeally, an algorithm that works well for a large system will also work with a smaller one; however, this is not always the case.\nIn order to determine the best algorithm for your system, it's often best to consult a tool computer scientists use to describe how algorithms scale with system size: complexity theory.\nHere's the idea: algorithms operate on data.\nComplexity theory uses different notations to describe how many operations an algorithm will need.\nIn this way, computational complexity measures runtime in terms of the number of operations an algorithm takes to complete its task.\nTo be clear, the notations used are not at all exact, but they roughly describe the run-time of code and can be used to estimate how long an algorithm should take to run.\nIn addition, there are many different notations depending on who you ask, but for now we'll focus on the big 3: O, \\Omega, and \\Theta.\nBig O assumes the worst, which is the often the most useful description of an algorithm.\nOn the other hand, \\Omega assumes the best and \\Theta is used when the best and worst cases are the same.\nOf the three Big O is used the most, and is used in conversation to mean that the algorithm will take \"on the order of\" n operations.\nUnfortunately, at this point, these notations might be a little vague.\nIn fact, it was incredibly vague for me for a long time, and it wasn't until I saw the notations in action that it all started to make sense, so that's what this section is about: providing concrete examples to better understand computational complexity notation.\nConstant Time\nLet's write some code that reads in an array of length n and runs with constant time:\nfunction constant(a::Array{Float64})\n    println(a[1])\nend\n\nObviously, no matter how large a is, this function will not take any longer to run.\nBecause of this, we say it has a constant runtime and notate it with O(1) = \\Omega(1) = \\Theta(1).\nBasically, we are saying that this function will run with 1 operation total (a single print).\nThe best-case runtime will be 1 operation, the worst-case runtime will be 1 operation, and because they are both the same, we can use \\Theta to notate that.\nNow imagine the following function:\nfunction constant(a::Array{Float64})\n    if (length(a) >= 3)\n        println(a[1])\n        println(a[2])\n        println(a[3])\n    end\nend\n\nThis function has 3 print statements, so it has 3 operations total.\nBecause of this, it's tempting to say that the runtime would be O(3) = \\Omega(3) = \\Theta(3), and you would not be wrong; however, complexity notations often make a big assumption: we don't care about constants!\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means that we get rid of all constants that are not 1!\nIn this case, that means we set O(3) = O(1).\nNow, I know what you are thinking, That's stupid! It's clear that the second function will take 3 times as long to run, shouldn't we notate that?\nYou're not wrong; however, complexity notation is mostly interested in how algorithms scale with larger and larger inputs.\nBecause we are talking about constant run-time, there is no scaling with larger inputs. No matter what array you read in to the above functions, they will always take a constant number of operations to finish.\nWhether that constant time is 1 operation or 3 operations doesn't really matter because different machines will have different runtimes anyway.\nNow, here's the thing: as we move on to more complicated examples, we will continue to ignore constants and extra terms to make the notation easier to understand.\nJust because this is common practice does not mean it's the best practice.\nI have run into several situation where knowing the constants has saved me hours of run-time, so keep in mind that all of these notations are somewhat vague and dependent on a number of auxiliary factors.\nStill, that doesn't mean the notation is completely useless. For now, let's keep moving forward with some more complicated (and useful) examples!\nLinear Time\nNow we are moving into interesting territory!\nLet's consider the following function:\nfunction linear(a::Array{Float64})\n    for i = 1:length(a)\n        println(a[i])\n    end\nend\n\nHere, it's clear that if we increase a by one element, we will need to do another operation.\nThat is, with an array of size n, we will need to do n operations, which means that our complexity is O(n) = \\Omega(n) = \\Theta(n).\nAs before, adding more operations into the for loop will change the constant in front of n in our complexity notation, but we'll continue to ignore those constants.\nFor example:\nfunction linear(a::Array{Float64})\n    println(\"The first element in our array is: \", a[1])\n\n    println(\"The sum of all pairs of elements in our array are...\")\n    for i = 1:length(a)/2\n        println(\"a is: \", a[2*i])\n        println(\"b is: \", a[2*i+1])\n        println(\"The sum of a and b is: \", a[2*i] + a[2*i+1])\n    end\n\n    println(\"The last element in our array is: \", a[end])\nend\n\nTechnically has a complexity of \\Theta(\\frac{3n}{2} + 2), but we'll just call it \\Theta(n).\nRegardless of the notation, if you see something that is O(n), you know that at worst it will run at the speed of a for loop, which is pretty good!\nPolynomial Time\nA promise of O(n) is not bad in terms of run-time; however, it is unlikely that you will run into too many straightforward algorithms that are O(n).\nFor example, let's say you have a square, 2D image and want to iterate through all of its points.\nWell, to do this, we might write code that looks something like:\n# Here, size is the length of a single side of the image\nfunction access_image(img::Array{Float64}, size::Int64)\n    for i = 1:size\n        for j = 1:size\n            index = j + i*size\n            println(img[index])\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nThis is a simple case where a nested for loop is perfectly acceptable, and it's obvious geometrically that we need to access \\mathrm{size}\\times\\mathrm{size} number of elements (because we are working with a square).\nThis means that this example has \\Theta(n^2) complexity. This is not great.\nIf you have to access 3D space, this might require \\Theta(n^3), which is even worse! Don't even get me started on 4D!\nIntuitively, if you see anything that has a polynomial runtime, it's easy to think of it as a bunch of nested for loops.\nThat said, there have been several cases throughout the history of algorithms where polynomial runtimes have inhibited certain algorithms from being used entirely, simply because it takes too long to run!\nFor this reason, if you can avoid writing nested for loops, you certainly should!\nHowever, there are several cases where this cannot be avoided, so don't spend too much time worrying about it unless runtime becomes an issue!\nExponential and Logarithmic Time\nThese are two more cases that come up all the time and often require a common theme: recursion.\nGenerally speaking, logarithmic algorithms are some of the fastest algorithms out there, while exponential algorithms are some of the slowest.\nUnfortunately, this means that recursion can be either the most useful tool in existence for realizing certain algorithms or the most harmful one, depending on your problem.\nHere is a simple example of a function with exponential runtime:\n# Here, n is the number of iterations\nfunction exponential(value::Int64, n::Int64)\n    println(value)\n    value += 1\n    exponential(value, n-1)\n    exponential(value, n-1)\nend\n\nHere, we read in the maximum number n we are iterating through and recursively call the exponential function, decrementing the number of iterations left each time.\nBecause we are calling the exponential function twice, this has a complexity of \\Theta(2^n), which is not great, but if it's the only way to get a job done, it's the only way to get a job done.\nLogarithmic algorithms can be thought of as the opposite of exponential ones.\nInstead of taking a value and computing more and more values each time, a good example of a logarithmic algorithm is one that takes an array and recursively divides it up, like so:\n# Here, cutoff is an arbitrary variable to know when to stop recursing\nfunction logarithmic(a::Array{Float64}, cutoff::Int64)\n    if (length(a) > cutoff)\n        logarithmic(a[1:length(a)/2], cutoff)\n        logarithmic(a[length(a)/2+1:end], cutoff)\n    end\n    println(length(a))\nend\n\nTo be honest, it is not obvious that the provided logarithmic function should operate in \\Theta(\\log(n)) time, where n is the size of a.\nThat said, I encourage you to think about an array of size 8.\nFirst, we split it in half, creating 2 arrays of 4 elements each.\nIf we split these new arrays, we have 4 arrays of 2, and if we split these by two we have 8 arrays of 1 element each.\nThis is as far as we can go, and we ended up dividing the array 3 times to get to this point.\n3 = \\log_2(8), so this function runs with a logarithmic number of operations.\nPutting it all together\nWe've outlined the most common complexity cases of different algorithms here, but at this point things might still be unclear.\nWhich is better: O(n^2) or O(log(n))?\nWell, let's plot all the different cases out, and the answer should become obvious.\n\n    \n\n\nHere, we see each of the complexity cases as n increases.\nClearly, linear time is not bad when compared to polynomial or exponential time; however, if you can manage something in logarithmic or constant time, do it!\nNow, there is a lot more to say about computational complexity and we'll definitely cover it at some point, but I can only move so fast!\nIn particular, I would love to have a discussion on the P=NP issue that has been rustling the jimmies of a few computer scientists for a while, but we'll get to that in due time.\nFinal Warning\nThis is a book about algorithms.\nIt would be nearly impossible to talk about most algorithms without touching on complexity theory and explaining why certain algorithms are faster than others.\nThat said, just because an algorithm runs in O(\\log n) does not mean it will always be faster than one that runs in O(n^2).\nBecause complexity notation often ignores constants, there could be a crazy constant that we are missing that actually makes a huge difference in runtime.\nIn addition, in order to use an algorithm that seems faster based on complexity notation, you may need to use a library that massively increases runtime due to a plethora of other reasons.\nBasically, take complexity notation with a grain of salt.\nIt is a useful descriptor of how fast algorithms should run in an ideal world; however, ideal worlds do not exist.\nWhen it comes to programming, there may be hundreds of other factors that need to be considered before implementing anything.\nThat said, complexity notation should not be ignored.\nIf you can easily implement an algorithm that is notationally faster with no repercussions, go for it!\nJust be sure you do not waste time trying to optimize code you haven't written yet.\nIn general, my advice would be the following:\nwrite code first and optimize what you can on the first run-through without going too far out of your way.\nIf the runtime is awful, go back and see about implementing algorithms that are faster based on complexity notation.\n\nMathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]);\n\n\n\\newcommand{\\d}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\bff}{\\boldsymbol{f}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfg}{\\boldsymbol{g}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfp}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfq}{\\boldsymbol{q}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfx}{\\boldsymbol{x}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfu}{\\boldsymbol{u}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfv}{\\boldsymbol{v}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\boldsymbol{A}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfB}{\\boldsymbol{B}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfC}{\\boldsymbol{C}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfM}{\\boldsymbol{M}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfJ}{\\boldsymbol{J}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfR}{\\boldsymbol{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfT}{\\boldsymbol{T}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfomega}{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}\n\\newcommand{\\bftau}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}\n\n"},"contents/bitlogic/bitlogic.html":{"url":"contents/bitlogic/bitlogic.html","title":"Bit Logic","keywords":"","body":"Bit Logic\nWe write code in a language that makes a little sense to us, but does not make sense at all to our computer without a compiler to transform the code we write into a language the computer can understand.\nIn the end, whenever we write code, all of the data structures we write are transformed into binary strings of 1's and 0's to be interpreted by our computer.\nThat said, it's not always obvious how this happens, so let's start the simple case of integer numbers.\nIntegers\nFor integer numbers, 0 is still 0 and 1 is still 1; however, for 2, we need to use 2 digits because binary only has 0's and 1's. When we get to 4, we'll need 3 digits and when we get to 8, we'll need 4. Ever time we cross a power of 2, we'll need to add a new digit. Here's a table of the first 10 integers in binary:\n\n\n\nInteger Number\nBinary Number\n\n\n\n\n0\n0000\n\n\n1\n0001\n\n\n2\n0010\n\n\n3\n0011\n\n\n4\n0100\n\n\n5\n0101\n\n\n6\n0110\n\n\n7\n0111\n\n\n8\n1000\n\n\n9\n1001\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to interpret a binary string is to imagine that each digit is a power of 2 and add them together. For example, take the number 13, with a bitstring 1101:\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n2^3\n2^2\n2^1\n2^0\n\n\n8\n4\n2\n1\n\n\n\nWe have 1 2^3 = 8, 1 2^2 = 4, 0 2^1 = 2 and 1 2^0 = 1, adding together to 13.\nThough this might seem straightforward, it is essential to understanding several operations that will be done on bits later.\nFor now, let's talk about the only trick to integer values: negative numbers!\nThere are a few ways to represent negative numbers.\nFor example, if we are using 8 bits, we might use the first of the 8 bits to be a sign bit, whose only purpose is telling the computer whether the number is positive or negative.\nAnother method is to \"roll over\" to negative numbers when the bit count gets too high, for example:\n\n\n\nInteger Number\nBinary Number\n\n\n\n\n126\n01111110\n\n\n127\n01111111\n\n\n-128\n10000000\n\n\n-127\n10000001\n\n\n\nUltimately, integer numbers are not that difficult to deal with in binary, so let's move onto something more complicated: floating-point numbers!\nFloating-point Numbers\nFloats are numbers with a decimal point.\n9.125 is a float. 9.000 is a float. 9 is an integer.\nHere are a few floats and their integer representations:\n\n\n\nFloating-point Number\nBinary Number\n\n\n\n\n9.125\n1001.001\n\n\n10.25\n1010.01\n\n\n1.00\n1\n\n\n\nThe idea is similar to before: Each digit represents a power of 2; however, this time any digit after the decimal point counts negative.\nSo for 9.125, we have 1 2^3 = 8, 1 2^0 = 1, and 1 2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{8}.\nNow, how is this actually implemented on your computer?\nWell, one way is with the IEEE 754 Floating-point Arithmetic Standard.\nFor 32 bits, the first bit is the sign bit, the next 8 bits tell us about the number's exponent, and the next 23 are called the mantissa and hold the binary string, itself. Now, there are a few points to keep in mind:\n\nBecause the exponent is being represented in 8 bits, we only have 256 values to play with. This means that the largest exponent we can represent (in single precision) is 128 and the smallest is -127. For this reason, we will add 127 to the power of every floating-point number. So, 1 = 1 \\times 2^{0}. The exponent stored is 0+127 = 127.\n\nWe normalize every bitstring to the first 1 available. For example: 9.125 = 1.001001 \\times 2^{3} and the biased exponent is 3+127=130, 8.25 = 1.00001 \\times 2^{130}, 0.5 = 1 \\times 2^{126} \\ldots This means that there will always be a leading 1 in our bitstring. This means that the first 1 is redundant and can be removed from the mantissa.\n\n\nSo here are a few floating-point numbers and their corresponding bitstrings:\n\n\n\nFloat\nSign\nExponent\nMantissa\n\n\n\n\n9.125\n0\n10000010\n00100100000000000000000\n\n\n- 5.25\n1\n10000001\n01010000000000000000000\n\n\n- 4096.625\n1\n10001011\n00000000000010100000000\n\n\n\nNow that we know how to represent integers and floating-point numbers, let's move on to operations, starting with bitshift operators\nBitshift Operators: >\nBitshift operators do what their name implies: they shift a string of bits one digit to the left (>).\nThis has the somewhat profound effect of multiplying or dividing the value by 2, which makes sense when you consider that each digit represents a power of 2.\nBecause of the somewhat complicated nature of floating-point numbers, bitshift operators usually only work on integer numbers, like so:\n\n\n\nOperation\nInteger\nBitstring\n\n\n\n\nNone\n10\n00001010\n\n\nBitshift left, \n20\n00010100\n\n\nBitshift right, >>\n5\n00000101\n\n\n\nThere are more complicated things that can be done with the bitshift operators; however, we'll leave that discussion for another day!\nLogic gates\nIn addition to the bitshift operations, there are a number of logical operations that can be performed on one or two bits together.\nThese operations are called gates, and follow soemwhat straightforward logic.\nThe AND gate, for example, reads in 2 bits and will only output a 1 value if both inputs are 1. This can be seen in the corresponding truth table:\n\n    \n\n\nThe OR gate will output 1 if either input bits are 1:\n\n    \n\n\nThe exclusive OR or XOR gate is the same as the OR gate, but will not output 1 if both bits are 1:\n\n    \n\n\nThe NOT gate simply flips the input bit:\n\n    \n\n\nBy combining the NOT and AND gates, we get the NAND gate:\n\n    \n\n\nAnd NOT and OR create NOR:\n\n    \n\n\nThere are a few other gates, but this is enough for most things. We'll add more as the need arises!\nThat's about it for bitlogic. I realize it was a bit long, but this is absolutely essential to understanding how computers think and how to use programming as an effective tool!\n\nMathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]);\n\n\n\\newcommand{\\d}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\bff}{\\boldsymbol{f}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfg}{\\boldsymbol{g}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfp}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfq}{\\boldsymbol{q}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfx}{\\boldsymbol{x}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfu}{\\boldsymbol{u}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfv}{\\boldsymbol{v}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\boldsymbol{A}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfB}{\\boldsymbol{B}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfC}{\\boldsymbol{C}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfM}{\\boldsymbol{M}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfJ}{\\boldsymbol{J}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfR}{\\boldsymbol{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfT}{\\boldsymbol{T}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfomega}{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}\n\\newcommand{\\bftau}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}\n\n"},"contents/convolutions/convolutions.html":{"url":"contents/convolutions/convolutions.html","title":"Convolutions","keywords":"","body":"Convolutions\nAlright, I am going to come right out and say it: convolutions can be confusing.\nNot only are they hard to really describe, but if you do not see them in practice, it's hard to understand why you would ever want to use them.\nI'm going to do what I can to describe them in an intuitive way; however, I may need to come back to this in the future.\nLet me know if there is anything here that is unclear, and I'll do what I can to clear it up.\nIf you take two functions f(x) and g(x), there are a number of ways you can combine them.\nAll basic operations can do this (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), but there are also special operations that only work with functions and do not work on standard variables or numbers.\nFor example, f \\circ g is a composition of the two functions, where you plug g(x) into f(x).\nA convolution is another function-related operation, and is often notated with a star (*) operator, where\nf(x)*g(x)=c(x)\nprovides a third function c(x) that blends f(x) and g(x).\nAs a rather important side-note: there is an incredibly similar operator known as a correlation which will be discussed in the near future.\nFor now, let's focus on convolutions, which are defined as:\n(f*g)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(\\xi)g(x-\\xi)d\\xi = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x-\\xi)g(\\xi)d\\xi\nNote that in this case, x is not necessarily a spatial element.\nOften times, it is time or something else entirely!\nThe easiest way to think about this is that the function g(x) is being shifted across all of space by the variable \\xi.\nAt every point x, we multiply f(x) and g(x) and integrate the multiplied output to find the convolution for that spatial step, (f*g)(x).\nNote that in code, this is often discretized to look like:\n(f*g)[n] = \\sum_{m = -\\infty}^{\\infty}f[m]g[n-m] = \\sum_{m = -\\infty}^{\\infty}f[n-m]g[m]\nWhere f[n] and g[n] are arrays of some form.\nThis means we basically just need to keep one array steady, flip the second array around, and move it through the first array one step at a time, performing a simple element-wise multiplication each step.\n\n\nIn code, this looks something like:\nfunction conv(signal1::Vector{Complex}, signal2::Vector{Complex})\n    n = length(signal1) + length(signal2)\n    out = Vector{Complex}(n)\n    sum = 0\n\n    for i = 0:n\n        for j = 0:i\n            if(j \nimport Data.List (tails)\n\nconvolution :: (Num a) => [a] -> [a] -> [a]\nconvolution x = map (sum . zipWith (*) (reverse x)) . spread\n  where spread = init . tails .

i \n\n\nNote that in this case, the output array will be the size of f[n] and g[n] put together.\nSometimes, though, we have an large size for f[n] and a small size for g[n].\nIn this case g[n] is often called a filter, and often times when we are using a filter on an array (that might represent an image or some form of data), we want the output array to be the same size as the input.\nIn this case, rather than outputting a larger array, we often do something special at the borders of the array.\nDepending on the situation, this may be necessary.\nNote that there are different methods to deal with the edges in this case, so it's best to do whatever seems right when the situation arises.\nConvolutional Theorem\nNow, let me tell you about a bit of black computational magic:\nConvolutions can be performed with Fourier Transforms!\nThat is crazy!\nIt's also incredibly hard to explain, so let me do my best.\nAs described in the chapter on Fourier Transforms, Fourier Transforms allow programmers to move from real space to frequency space.\nWhen we transform a wave into frequency space, we see a single peak in frequency space related to the frequency of that wave.\nNo matter what function we send into a Fourier Transform, the frequency-space image can be interpreted as a series of different waves with a specified frequency.\nSo here's the idea: if we take two functions f(x) and g(x) and move them to frequency space to be \\hat f(\\xi) and \\hat g(\\xi), we can then multiply those two functions and transform them back into a third function to blend the signals together.\nIn this way, we will have a third function that relates the frequency-space images of the two input functions.\nThis is precisely a convolution!\nDon't believe me?\nWell, this is because of something known as the convolution theorem which looks something like this:\n\\mathcal{F}(f*g) = \\mathcal{F}(f) \\cdot \\mathcal{F}(g)\nWhere \\mathcal{F} denotes the Fourier Transform.\nNow, by using a Fast Fourier Transform (fft) in code, this can take a standard convolution on two arrays of length n, which is an \\mathcal{O}(n^2) process, to \\mathcal{O}(n\\log(n)).\nThis means that the convolution theorem is fundamental to creating fast convolutional methods for large inputs, assuming that both of the input signals are similar sizes.\nThat said, it is debatable whether the convolution theorem will be faster when the filter size is small.\nAlso: depending on the language used, we might need to read in a separate library for FFT's.\nThat said, Julia has an in-built fft routine, so the code for this method could not be simpler:\nfunction conv_fft(signal1::Vector{Complex}, signal2::Vector{Complex})\n    return ifft(fft(signal1).*fft(signal2))\nend\n\nWhere the .* operator is an element-wise multiplication.\nThe FFT-based convolution in Haskell is complicated, so here is some simple julia code:\nfunction conv_fft(signal1::Vector{Complex}, signal2::Vector{Complex})\n    return ifft(fft(signal1).*fft(signal2))\nend\n\nWhere the .* operator is an element-wise multiplication.\nvoid conv_fft(double complex *signal1, double complex *signal2,\n              double complex* out, size_t n) {\n    fft(signal1, n);\n    fft(signal2, n);\n\n    for (size_t i = 0; i \ntemplate \nvoid conv_fft(S1 const s1, S1 const s1_last, S2 const s2, Out const out) {\n  auto const size = s1_last - s1;\n\n  fft(s1, s1_last);\n  fft(s2, s2 + size);\n\n  auto s1_it = s1;\n  auto s2_it = s2;\n  auto out_it = out;\n  for (; s1_it != s1_last; ++s1_it, ++s2_it, ++out_it) {\n    *out_it = *s1_it * *s2_it;\n  }\n\n  inverse_fft(out, out_it);\n}\n\n\n\nThis method also has the added advantage that it will always output an array of the size of your signal; however, if your signals are not of equal size, we need to pad the smaller signal with zeros.\nAlso note that the Fourier Transform is a periodic or cyclical operation, so there are no real edges in this method, instead the arrays \"wrap around\" to the other side.\nFor this reason, this convolution is often called a cyclic convolution instead of a linear convolution like above.\nNote that cyclic convolutions can definitely still be done without Fourier Transforms and we can do linear convolutions with Fourier Transforms, but it makes the code slightly more complicated than described above.\n\n\nMathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]);\n\n\n\\newcommand{\\d}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\bff}{\\boldsymbol{f}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfg}{\\boldsymbol{g}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfp}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfq}{\\boldsymbol{q}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfx}{\\boldsymbol{x}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfu}{\\boldsymbol{u}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfv}{\\boldsymbol{v}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\boldsymbol{A}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfB}{\\boldsymbol{B}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfC}{\\boldsymbol{C}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfM}{\\boldsymbol{M}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfJ}{\\boldsymbol{J}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfR}{\\boldsymbol{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfT}{\\boldsymbol{T}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfomega}{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}\n\\newcommand{\\bftau}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}\n\n"},"contents/taylor_series_expansion/taylor_series_expansion.html":{"url":"contents/taylor_series_expansion/taylor_series_expansion.html","title":"Taylor Series","keywords":"","body":"NOTE: Incomplete!\nTaylor Series Expansion\nI have been formally trained as a physicist. In my mind, there are several mathematical topics that blur the boundary between mathematics and physics. Taylor Series Expansions are one of those topics.\nOn the one hand, I can see how the expansion could be considered purely mathematical. I mean, here is the definition:\n\nf(x) \\simeq \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n\n\nwhere f(x) is some function along real or complex space, a is the point that we are expanding from, and f^{(n)}(x) denotes the n^{\\text{th}} derivative of f(x).\nFrom this perspective, the expansion just looks like a bunch of derivatives strung together! Where's the physics? Well, let's expand this series for the first few derivatives:\n\nf(x) \\simeq f(a) + \\frac{df(a)}{dx}(x-a)\n    + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2f(a)}{dx^2}(x-a)^2\n\nIf we substitute the derivatives for their physical quantities with f(x) \\rightarrow x(t), expanding from 0, and set\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} &= \\text{velocity} = v(t) \\\\\n\\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} &= \\text{acceleration} = a \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nThe Taylor series expansion turns into one of the most common formulas in classical physics, the kinematic equation!\n\nx(t) \\simeq x_0 + v_0t\n    + \\frac{1}{2}at^2\n\nNote that here, we assume the acceleration to be constant, but it could technically have higher order terms.\nTruth be told, the Taylor Series Expansion can be found in the most unusual places and is used as the foundation of many different algorithms throughout this book. At first, it might not seem obvious why, but we can approximate almost any smooth function with a Taylor Series Expansion, and the more terms we include, the better our approximation becomes! For example, take Figure 1. Any function can be approximated as a sum of all the derivatives for that function. If we evaluate these derivatives at any point, we closely approximate the actual function.\n\n    \n\n\nThis shows the true power of the Taylor Series Expansion. It allows us to more easily tackle complicated functions by approximating them as functions we can actually use and imagine!\n\nMathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]);\n\n\n\\newcommand{\\d}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\bff}{\\boldsymbol{f}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfg}{\\boldsymbol{g}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfp}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfq}{\\boldsymbol{q}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfx}{\\boldsymbol{x}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfu}{\\boldsymbol{u}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfv}{\\boldsymbol{v}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\boldsymbol{A}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfB}{\\boldsymbol{B}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfC}{\\boldsymbol{C}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfM}{\\boldsymbol{M}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfJ}{\\boldsymbol{J}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfR}{\\boldsymbol{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfT}{\\boldsymbol{T}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfomega}{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}\n\\newcommand{\\bftau}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}\n\n"},"contents/sorting_and_searching/sorting_and_searching.html":{"url":"contents/sorting_and_searching/sorting_and_searching.html","title":"Sorting and Searching","keywords":"","body":"Sorting and Searching\nWhen it comes to algorithms that programmers know and love, the stereotypical examples are often algorithms that either sort or search through a given container of elements.\nFor the most part, sorting and searching methods are two sides to the same coin and are almost always described together due to their similarities.\nTo be honest, they are also good thought exercises for new programmers.\nIt's often inspiring to hear how individuals who have no programming experience go about solving the problem, because there are so many ways to do it!\nAll said, sorting and searching are fundamental to numerous algorithms and really show how computer science has evolved with time to lower the complexity of problems that seem straightforward at first-glance.\nAs the Archive evolves, more and more sorting algorithms will be added, so feel free to let me know your favorite algorithm and I'll do my best to put it in!\nRight now, there are only a few (straightforward) examples, so expect some more complicated algorithms in the future!\n\nMathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]);\n\n\n\\newcommand{\\d}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\bff}{\\boldsymbol{f}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfg}{\\boldsymbol{g}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfp}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfq}{\\boldsymbol{q}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfx}{\\boldsymbol{x}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfu}{\\boldsymbol{u}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfv}{\\boldsymbol{v}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\boldsymbol{A}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfB}{\\boldsymbol{B}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfC}{\\boldsymbol{C}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfM}{\\boldsymbol{M}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfJ}{\\boldsymbol{J}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfR}{\\boldsymbol{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfT}{\\boldsymbol{T}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfomega}{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}\n\\newcommand{\\bftau}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}\n\n"},"contents/bubble_sort/bubble_sort.html":{"url":"contents/bubble_sort/bubble_sort.html","title":"Bubble Sort","keywords":"","body":"Bubble Sort\nWhen it comes to sorting algorithms, Bubble Sort is usually the first that comes to mind.\nThough it might not be the fastest tool in the shed, it's definitely straightforward to implement and is often the first sorting method new programmers think of when trying to implement a sorting method on their own.\nHere's how it works: we go through each element in our vector and check to see if it is larger than the element to it's right.\nIf it is, we swap the elements and then move to the next element.\nIn this way, we sweep through the array n times for each element and continually swap any two adjacent elements that are improperly ordered.\nThis means that we need to go through the vector \\mathcal{O}(n^2) times with code similar to the following:\nfunction bubble_sort(a::Vector{Float64})\n    n = length(a)\n    for i = 1:n\n        for j = 1:n-1\n            if(a[j] \npublic static List RunBubbleSort(List list) where T : IComparable\n{\n    var length = list.Count;\n\n    for (int i = 0;

Instead, we need to use more interesting methods to work through each element. This is often called Tree Traversal, and there are many different ways to do this. For now, we will restrict the discussion to two common and related methods of tree traversal: Depth-First and Breadth-First Search. Note that trees vary greatly in shape and size depending on how they are used; however, they are composed primarily of nodes that house other, children nodes, like so:\nstruct Node\n    children::Vector{Node}\n    ID::Int64\n    Node(ID::Int64) = new(Vector{Node}(), ID)\nend\n\nstruct node {\n  std::vector children;\n  int value;\n};\n\npublic class Tree\n{\n    public int Id { get; private set; }\n    private List _children = new List();\n\nstruct node {\n    struct node *children;\n    size_t children_size;\n    int id;\n};\n\nprivate class Node implements Comparable {\n    public ArrayList children;\n    public int id;\n\n    public Node(int id) {\n        this.children = new ArrayList();\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int compareTo(Node other) {\n        // Need to implement Comparable and override this\n        // method because of the method BFSQueue() which uses Queues\n        // and must know how to check if two nodes are the same or not\n        return Integer.compare(this.id, other.id);\n    }\n}\n\nThis has not been implemented in your chosen language, so here is the Julia code\nstruct Node\n    children::Vector{Node}\n    ID::Int64\n    Node(ID::Int64) = new(Vector{Node}(), ID)\nend\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = None\n        self.children = []\n\n\n  \nstruct Node {\n    children: Vec,\n    value: u64,\n}\n\ndata Tree a = Node { node :: a\n                   , forest :: [Tree a]\n                   } deriving (Show)\n\n\n\nBecause of this, the most straightforward way to traverse the tree might be recursive. This naturally leads us to the Depth-First Search (DFS) method:\nfunction DFS_recursive(n::Node)\n    # Here we are doing something...\n    println(n.ID)\n\n    for child in n.children\n        DFS_recursive(child)\n    end\nend\n\n// Simple recursive scheme for DFS\nvoid dfs_recursive(node const& n) {\n  // Here we are doing something...\n  std::cout \npublic void DFSRecursive()\n{\n    DFSRecursive(this);\n\n    void DFSRecursive(Tree tree)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(tree.Id);\n\n        foreach (var c in tree._children)\n            DFSRecursive(c);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid dfs_recursive(struct node n) {\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", n.id);\n\n    if (n.children) {\n        for (size_t i = 0; i \nprivate void dfsRecursive(Node node) {\n    System.out.println(node.id);\n\n    for (Node n : node.children) {\n        dfsRecursive(n);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction dfsPreorder(tree) {\n  console.log(tree.id);\n  tree.children.forEach(dfsPreorder);\n}\n\ndef DFS_recursive(node):\n    if node.data != None:\n        print(node.data)\n\n    for child in node.children:\n        DFS_recursive(child)\n\n\n  \n  \nfn dfs_recursive(n: &Node) {\n    println!(\"{}\", n.value);\n\n    for child in &n.children {\n        dfs_recursive(child);\n    }\n}\n\ndfs :: Tree a -> [a]\ndfs (Node x ts) = x : concatMap dfs ts\n\n\n\nAt least to me, this makes a lot of sense. We fight recursion with recursion! First, we first output the node we are on and then we call DFS_recursive(...) on each of its children nodes. This method of tree traversal does what its name implies: it goes to the depths of the tree first before going through the rest of the branches. In this case, the ordering looks like:\n\n    \n\n\nNote that the in the code above, we are missing a crucial step: checking to see if the node we are using actually exists! Because we are using a vector to store all the nodes, we will be careful not to run into a case where we call DFS_recursive(...) on a node that has yet to be initialized; however, depending on the language we are using, we might need to be careful of this to avoid recursion errors!\nNow, in this case the first element searched through is still the root of the tree. This type of tree traversal is known as pre-order DFS. We perform an action (output the ID) before searching through the children. If we shift the function around and place the data output at the end of the function, we can modify the order in which we search through the tree to be post-order and look something like this:\nfunction DFS_recursive_postorder(n::Node)\n\n    for child in n.children\n        DFS_recursive_postorder(child)\n    end\n\n    # Here we are doing something...\n    println(n.ID)\nend\n\nThis has not been implemented in your chosen language, so here is the Julia code\nfunction DFS_recursive_postorder(n::Node)\n\n    for child in n.children\n        DFS_recursive_postorder(child)\n    end\n\n    # Here we are doing something...\n    println(n.ID)\nend\n\npublic void DFSRecursivePostorder()\n{\n    DFSRecursivePostorder(this);\n\n    void DFSRecursivePostorder(Tree tree)\n    {\n        foreach (var c in tree._children)\n            DFSRecursivePostorder(c);\n\n        Console.WriteLine(tree.Id);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid dfs_recursive_postorder(struct node n) {\n    for (size_t i = 0; i \nprivate void dfsRecursivePostOrder(Node node) {\n    for (Node n : node.children) {\n        dfsRecursivePostOrder(n);\n    }\n\n    // Here we are doing something ...\n    System.out.println(node.id);\n}\n\nfunction dfsPostorder(tree) {\n  tree.children.forEach(dfsPostorder);\n  console.log(tree.id);\n}\n\ndef DFS_recursive_postorder(node):\n    for child in node.children:\n        DFS_recursive(child)\n\n    if node.data != None:\n        print(node.data)\n\n\n  \nThis has not been implemented in your chosen language, so here is the Julia code\nfunction DFS_recursive_postorder(n::Node)\n\n    for child in n.children\n        DFS_recursive_postorder(child)\n    end\n\n    # Here we are doing something...\n    println(n.ID)\nend\n\ndfsPostOrder :: Tree a -> [a]\ndfsPostOrder (Node x ts) = concatMap dfsPostOrder ts ++ [x]\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nIn this case, the first node visited is at the bottom of the tree and moves up the tree branch by branch. In addition to these two types, binary trees have an in-order traversal scheme that looks something like this:\n# This assumes only 2 children, but accounts for other possibilities\nfunction DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n::Node)\n\n    if (length(n.children) == 2)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[1])\n        println(n.ID)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[2])\n    elseif (length(n.children) == 1)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[1])\n        println(n.ID)\n    elseif (length(n.children) == 0)\n        println(n.ID)\n    else\n        println(\"Not a binary tree!\")\n    end\nend\n\nThis has not been implemented in your chosen language, so here is the Julia code\n# This assumes only 2 children, but accounts for other possibilities\nfunction DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n::Node)\n\n    if (length(n.children) == 2)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[1])\n        println(n.ID)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[2])\n    elseif (length(n.children) == 1)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[1])\n        println(n.ID)\n    elseif (length(n.children) == 0)\n        println(n.ID)\n    else\n        println(\"Not a binary tree!\")\n    end\nend\n\npublic void DFSRecursiveInorderBinary()\n{\n    DFSRecursiveInorderBinary(this);\n\n    // This assumes only 2 children\n    void DFSRecursiveInorderBinary(Tree tree)\n    {\n        if (tree._children.Count > 2)\n            throw new Exception(\"Not binary tree!\");\n\n        if (tree._children.Count > 0)\n        {\n            DFSRecursiveInorderBinary(tree._children[0]);\n            Console.WriteLine(tree.Id);\n            DFSRecursiveInorderBinary(tree._children[1]);\n        }\n        else\n            Console.WriteLine(tree.Id);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid dfs_recursive_inorder_btree(struct node n) {\n    switch (n.children_size) {\n    case 2:\n        dfs_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[0]);\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", n.id);\n        dfs_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[1]);\n        break;\n    case 1:\n        dfs_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[0]);\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", n.id);\n        break;\n    case 0:\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", n.id);\n        break;\n    default:\n        printf(\"This is not a binary tree.\\n\");\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\n// This assumes only 2 children\nprivate void dfsRecursiveInOrderBinary(Node node) {\n    if (node.children.size() > 2) {\n        System.err.println(\"Not a binary tree at dfsRecursiveInOrderBinary()!\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (node.children.size() > 1) {\n        dfsRecursiveInOrderBinary(node.children.get(0));\n        System.out.println(node.id);\n        dfsRecursiveInOrderBinary(node.children.get(1));\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(node.id);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction dfsInorder(tree) {\n  if (!tree) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  if (tree.children.length > 2) {\n    throw new Error(\"Postorder traversal is only valid for binary trees\");\n  }\n\n  dfsInorder(tree.children[0]);\n  console.log(tree.id);\n  dfsInorder(tree.children[1]);\n}\n\n# This assumes only 2 children, but accounts for other possibilities\ndef DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(node):\n    if (len(node.children) == 2):\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(node.children[1])\n        print(node.data)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(node.children[2])\n    elif (len(node.children) == 1):\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(node.children[1])\n        print(node.data)\n    elif (len(node.children) == 0):\n        print(node.data)\n    else:\n        print(\"Not a binary tree!\")\n\n\n  \nThis has not been implemented in your chosen language, so here is the Julia code\n# This assumes only 2 children, but accounts for other possibilities\nfunction DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n::Node)\n\n    if (length(n.children) == 2)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[1])\n        println(n.ID)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[2])\n    elseif (length(n.children) == 1)\n        DFS_recursive_inorder_btree(n.children[1])\n        println(n.ID)\n    elseif (length(n.children) == 0)\n        println(n.ID)\n    else\n        println(\"Not a binary tree!\")\n    end\nend\n\ndfsInOrder :: Tree a -> [a] -- For binary trees only\ndfsInOrder (Node x [])     = [x]\ndfsInOrder (Node x [l])    = dfsInOrder l ++ [x] -- Single branch assumed to be left\ndfsInOrder (Node x [l, r]) = dfsInOrder l ++ [x] ++ dfsInOrder r\ndfsInOrder _               = error \"Not a binary tree\"\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe order here seems to be some mix of the other 2 methods and works through the binary tree from left to right.\nNow, at this point, it might seem that the only way to search through a recursive data structure is with recursion, but this is not necessarily the case! Rather surprisingly, we can perform a DFS non-recursively by using a stack, which are data structures that hold multiple elements, but only allow you to interact with the very last element you put in. The idea here is simple:\n\nPut the root node in the stack\nTake it out and put in its children\nPop the top of the stack and put its children in\nRepeat 3 until the stack is empty\n\nIn code, it looks like this:\nfunction DFS_stack(n::Node)\n    s = Stack(Node)\n    push!(s, n)\n\n    while(length(s) > 0)\n        println(top(s).ID)\n        temp = pop!(s)\n        for child in temp.children\n            push!(s, child)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n// Simple non-recursive scheme for DFS\nvoid dfs_stack(node const& n) {\n  // this stack holds pointers into n's `children` vector,\n  // or its children's `children` vector.\n  std::stack stack;\n  stack.push(&n);\n\n  while (stack.size() > 0) {\n    auto const& temp = *stack.top();\n    stack.pop();\n    std::cout \npublic void DFSStack()\n{\n    var stack = new Stack();\n    stack.Push(this);\n\n    while (stack.Count != 0)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(stack.Peek().Id);\n        var temp = stack.Pop();\n\n        foreach (var c in temp._children)\n            stack.Push(c);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid dfs_stack(struct node n) {\n    struct stack stk = get_stack(sizeof(struct node*));\n    stack_push(&stk, &n);\n    struct node *tmp;\n\n    while (!stack_empty(&stk)) {\n        tmp = (struct node*)stack_pop(&stk);\n        if (!tmp) {\n            break;\n        }\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", tmp->id);\n        for (size_t i = 0; i children_size; ++i) {\n            stack_push(&stk, &tmp->children[i]);\n        }\n    }\n\n    free_stack(stk);\n}\n\npublic void dfsStack() {\n    Stack stack = new Stack();\n    stack.push(this.root);\n\n    Node tmp;\n\n    while (stack.size() != 0) {\n        System.out.println(stack.peek().id);\n        tmp = stack.pop();\n\n        for (Node c : tmp.children) {\n            stack.push(c);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunction dfsIterative(tree) {\n  const stack = [tree];\n  while (stack.length > 0) {\n    const current = stack.pop();\n    console.log(current.id);\n    stack.push(...current.children);\n  }\n}\n\ndef DFS_stack(node):\n    stack = []\n    stack.append(node)\n\n    temp = None\n\n    while len(stack) > 0:\n        print(stack[-1].data)\n        temp = stack.pop()\n\n        for child in temp.children:\n            stack.append(child)\n\n\n  \nfn dfs_stack(n: &Node) {\n    let mut stack = vec![n];\n\n    while let Some(current) = stack.pop() {\n        println!(\"{}\", current.value);\n        stack.extend(&current.children);\n    }\n}\n\nThis has not been implemented in your chosen language, so here is the Julia code\nfunction DFS_stack(n::Node)\n    s = Stack(Node)\n    push!(s, n)\n\n    while(length(s) > 0)\n        println(top(s).ID)\n        temp = pop!(s)\n        for child in temp.children\n            push!(s, child)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n\n\nAll this said, there are a few details about DFS that might not be idea, depending on the situation. For example, if we use DFS on an incredibly long tree, we will spend a lot of time going further and further down a single branch without searching the rest of the data structure. In addition, it is not the natural way humans would order a tree if asked to number all the nodes from top to bottom. I would argue a more natural traversal order would look something like this:\n\n    \n\n\nAnd this is exactly what Breadth-First Search (BFS) does! On top of that, it can be implemented in the same way as the DFS_stack(...) function above, simply by swapping the stack for a queue, which is similar to a stack, except that it only allows you to interact with the very first element instead of the last. In code, this looks something like:\nfunction BFS_queue(n::Node)\n    q = Queue(Node)\n    enqueue!(q, n)\n\n    while(length(q) > 0)\n        println(front(q).ID)\n        temp = dequeue!(q)\n        for child in temp.children\n            enqueue!(q, child)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n// simple non-recursive scheme for BFS\nvoid bfs_queue(node const& n) {\n  std::queue queue;\n

Algorithm","keywords":"","body":"Euclidean Algorithm\nComputer science is (almost by definition) a science about computers -- a device first conceptualized in the 1800's. Computers have become so revolutionary, that it is difficult to think of our lives today without them. That said, algorithms are much older and have existed in the world for millenia. Incredibly, a few of the algorithms created before the Common Era (AD) are still in use today. One such algorithm was first described in Euclid's Elements (~ 300 BC) and has come to be known as the Euclidean Algorithm.\nThe algorithm is a simple way to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is useful for a number of different applications (like reducing fractions). The first method (envisioned by Euclid) uses simple subtraction:\nint euclid_sub(int a, int b) {\n    a = abs(a);\n    b = abs(b);\n\n    while (a != b) {\n        if (a > b) {\n            a -= b;\n        } else {\n            b -= a;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\npublic int EuclidSub(int a, int b)\n{\n    // Math.Abs for negative number support\n    a = Math.Abs(a);\n    b = Math.Abs(b);\n\n    while (a != b)\n    {\n        if (a > b)\n            a = a - b;\n        else\n            b = b - a;\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\n(defn euclid-sub [a b]\n  (loop [i (Math/abs a) j (Math/abs b)]\n    (if (= i j)\n      i\n      (if (> i j)\n        (recur (- i j) j)\n        (recur i (- j i))))))\n\nint euclid_sub(int a, int b) {\n  a = std::abs(a);\n  b = std::abs(b);\n\n  while (a != b) {\n    if (a > b) {\n      a -= b;\n    } else {\n      b -= a;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return a;\n}\n\npublic static int euclidSub(int a, int b) {\n    a = Math.abs(a);\n    b = Math.abs(b);\n\n    while (a != b) {\n        if (a > b) {\n            a -= b;\n        } else {\n            b -= a;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\nfunction euclid_sub(a, b){\n    a = Math.abs(a);\n    b = Math.abs(b);\n\n    while (a != b){\n        if (a > b){\n            a = a - b;\n        }\n        else{\n            b = b - a;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\ndef euclid_sub(a, b):\n\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n\n    while a != b:\n        if a > b:\n            a -= b\n        else:\n            b -= a\n\n    return a\n\neuclidSub :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer\neuclidSub a b = inner (abs a) (abs b)\n  where\n    inner x y\n      | x == y = x\n      | x \nfn euclid_sub(mut a: i64, mut b: i64) -> i64 {\n    a = a.abs();\n    b = b.abs();\n    while a != b {\n        if a \nlet euclid_sub a b =\n  let rec inner a b =\n    if a = b then\n      a\n    else if a \nfunc euclidSub(a, b int) int {\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n\n    for a != b {\n        if a > b {\n            a -= b\n        } else {\n            b -= a\n        }\n    }\n\n    return a\n}\n\nfunc euclidSub(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {\n    var a = abs(a)\n    var b = abs(b)\n\n    while (a != b) {\n        if (a > b) {\n            a -= b\n        } else {\n            b -= a\n        }\n    }\n\n    return a\n}\n\nfunction gcd = euclidSub(a,b)\n\n    a = abs(a);\n    b = abs(b);\n\n    while a ~= b\n        if a > b\n            a = a - b;\n        else\n            b = b - a;\n        end\n    end\n\n    gcd = a;\nend\n\nfunction euclidSub (a, b)\n  local a = math.abs(a)\n  local b = math.abs(b)\n\n  while a ~= b do\n    if a > b then\n      a = a-b\n    else\n      b = b-a\n    end\n  end\n\n  return a\nend\n\n\n\nHere, we simply line the two numbers up every step and subtract the lower value from the higher one every timestep. Once the two values are equal, we call that value the greatest common divisor. A graph of a and b as they change every step would look something like this:\n\n    \n\n\nModern implementations, though, often use the modulus operator (%) like so\nint euclid_mod(int a, int b) {\n    a = abs(a);\n    b = abs(b);\n\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\npublic int EuclidMod(int a, int b)\n{\n    // Math.Abs for negative number support\n    a = Math.Abs(a);\n    b = Math.Abs(b);\n\n    while (b != 0)\n    {\n        var temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\n(defn euclid-mod [a b]\n  (loop [i (Math/abs a) j (Math/abs b)]\n    (if (zero? j)\n      i\n      (recur j (% i j)))))\n\n// Euclidean algorithm using modulus\nint euclid_mod(int a, int b) {\n  a = std::abs(a);\n  b = std::abs(b);\n\n  while (b != 0) {\n    a = std::exchange(b, a % b);\n  }\n\n  return a;\n}\n\npublic static int euclidMod(int a, int b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int tmp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = tmp;\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\nfunction euclid_mod(a, b){\n    a = Math.abs(a);\n    b = Math.abs(b);\n\n    var temp;\n    while (b != 0){\n        temp = b;\n        b = a%b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\ndef euclid_mod(a, b):\n\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n\n    while b > 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\neuclidMod :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer\neuclidMod a b = inner (abs a) (abs b)\n  where\n    inner x 0 = x\n    inner x y = inner y (x `mod` y)\n\nfn euclid_rem(mut a: i64, mut b: i64) -> i64 {\n    a = a.abs();\n    b = b.abs();\n    while b != 0 {\n        let tmp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = tmp;\n    }\n\n    a\n}\n\nlet euclid_mod a b =\n  let rec inner a = function\n  | 0 -> a\n  | b -> inner b (a mod b)\n  in (inner (abs a) (abs b))\n\nfunc euclidMod(a, b int) int {\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n\n    for b != 0 {\n        a, b = b, a%b\n    }\n\n    return a\n}\n\nfunc euclidMod(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {\n    var a = abs(a);\n    var b = abs(b);\n\n    while (b != 0) {\n        let temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    }\n\n    return a\n}\n\nfunction gcd = euclidMod(a,b)\n\n    a=abs(a);\n    b=abs(b);\n\n    while b > 0\n        temp = b;\n        b = mod(a,b);\n        a = temp;\n    end\n\n    gcd = a;\nend\n\nfunction euclidMod (a, b)\n  local a = math.abs(a)\n  local b = math.abs(b)\n\n  while b ~= 0 do\n    a, b = b, a%b\n  end\n\n  return a\nend\n\n\n\nHere, we set b to be the remainder of a%b and a to be whatever b was last timestep. Because of how the modulus operator works, this will provide the same information as the subtraction-based implementation, but when we show a and b as they change with time, we can see that it might take many fewer steps:\n\n    \n\n\nThe Euclidean Algorithm is truly fundamental to many other algorithms throughout the history of computer science and will definitely be used again later. At least to me, it's amazing how such an ancient algorithm can still have modern use and appeal. That said, there are still other algorithms out there that can find the greatest common divisor of two numbers that are arguably better in certain cases than the Euclidean algorithm, but the fact that we are discussing Euclid two millenia after his death shows how timeless and universal mathematics truly is. I think that's pretty cool.\nExample Code\n#include \n#include \n\nint euclid_mod(int a, int b) {\n    a = abs(a);\n    b = abs(b);\n\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\nint euclid_sub(int a, int b) {\n    a = abs(a);\n    b = abs(b);\n\n    while (a != b) {\n        if (a > b) {\n            a -= b;\n        } else {\n            b -= a;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return a;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int check1 = euclid_mod(64 * 67, 64 * 81);\n    int check2 = euclid_sub(128 * 12, 128 * 77);\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", check1);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", check2);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nEuclideanAlgorithm.cs\n// submitted by Julian Schacher (jspp)\nusing System;\n\nnamespace EuclideanAlgorithm\n{\n    public class EuclideanAlgorithm\n    {\n        public int EuclidSub(int a, int b)\n        {\n            // Math.Abs for negative number support\n            a = Math.Abs(a);\n            b = Math.Abs(b);\n\n            while (a != b)\n            {\n                if (a > b)\n                    a = a -

Though these applications are not mathematics, they use mathematics in everything they do and the methods to manipulate matrices are certainly mathematical.

We'll be filling more in as we go along!\n\nMathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]);\n\n\n\\newcommand{\\d}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\bff}{\\boldsymbol{f}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfg}{\\boldsymbol{g}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfp}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfq}{\\boldsymbol{q}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfx}{\\boldsymbol{x}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfu}{\\boldsymbol{u}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfv}{\\boldsymbol{v}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\boldsymbol{A}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfB}{\\boldsymbol{B}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfC}{\\boldsymbol{C}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfM}{\\boldsymbol{M}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfJ}{\\boldsymbol{J}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfR}{\\boldsymbol{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfT}{\\boldsymbol{T}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfomega}{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}\n\\newcommand{\\bftau}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}\n\n"},"contents/gaussian_elimination/gaussian_elimination.html":{"url":"contents/gaussian_elimination/gaussian_elimination.html","title":"Gaussian Elimination","keywords":"","body":"Gaussian Elimination\nSo, how exactly do we go about solving a system of linear equations? Well, one way is Gaussian Elimination, which you may have encountered before in a math class or two. The basic idea is that we take a system of equations,\n\n\\begin{align}\n2x + 3y + 4z &= 6 \\\\\nx + 2y + 3z &= 4 \\\\\n3x - 4y &= 10\n\\end{align}\n\nand turn it into a matrix by using the coefficients in front of each variable\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n2 & 3  & 4\\\\\n1 & 2 & 3\\\\\n3 & -4 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n=\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n6 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n10\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nOr more simply:\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n3 & -4 & 0 & 10\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nNow, at first, this doesn't seem to help anything, so let's think of this in another way. Wouldn't it be great if the system of equations looked like this:\n\n\\begin{align}\n2x + 3y + 4z &= 6 \\\\\ny + 2z &= 2 \\\\\n11z &= 18\n\\end{align}\n\nThen we could just solve for z and plug that value in to the top two equations to solve for x and y! In matrix form, it would look like this\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 11 & 18\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nThis matrix form has a particular name: Row Echelon Form.\nBasically, any matrix can be considered in row echelon form if\n\nAll non-zero rows are above rows of all zeros\nThe leading coefficient or pivot (the first non-zero element in every row when reading from left to right) is right of the pivot of the row above it.\n\nAll the following examples are in the row echelon form:\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 11 & 18\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\;,\\;\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n5 & 4  & 0 & 10 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 5 & 7 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\;,\\;\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n1 & -3 & 4 & 1 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 3 & 3 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\;,\\;\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nThe first two are probably the ones we are interested in, at the very least they have the right dimensions to solve a system of equations.\nThe last two systems are either under- or over-constrained; however, if you translate the last row of second matrix into a system, you get 0=1, which is a contradiction.\nThis is due to the fact that the matrix is singular, and there are no solutions to this particular system. Nevertheless, all of these matrices are in row echelon form.\nNow, it seems obvious to point out that if we ignore the last column, row echelon form is an upper triangular matrix.\nThis might not be important now, but it will play an important role in future discussions, so keep it buzzing in the back of your brain.\nNow, row echelon form is nice, but wouldn't it be even better if our system of equations looked simply like this\n\n\\begin{align}\nx &= \\frac{18}{11} \\\\\ny &= \\frac{-14}{11} \\\\\nz &= \\frac{18}{11}\n\\end{align}\n\nThen we would know exactly what x, y, and z are without any fuss! In matrix form, it looks like\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{18}{11} \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{-14}{11} \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & \\frac{18}{11} \n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nAnd that's where we really want to get to for obvious reasons.\nThis introduces yet another matrix configuration:  Reduced Row Echelon Form.\nA matrix is in reduced row echelon form if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\nIt is in row echelon form.\nEvery pivot is 1 and is the only nonzero entry in its column.\n\nAll the following examples are in the reduced row echelon form:\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & -3 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 9\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\;,\\;\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 4  & 0 & 9 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 7 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\;,\\;\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nAgain, only the first one (the identity matrix looking guy) is desirable in the context of solving a system of equations, but transforming any matrix in this form gives us an immediate and definitive answer at the question: can I solve my system?\nBeyond solving a system, reshaping a matrix in this form makes it very easy to deduce other properties of the matrix, such as the rank.\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximal number of linearly independent columns, in reduced row echelon form, the rank is simply the number of pivots.\nFor now, I hope the motivation is clear: we want to convert a matrix into row echelon and then reduced row echelon form to make large systems of equations trivial to solve, so we need some method to do that.\nIn general, the term Gaussian Elimination refers to the process of transforming a matrix into row echelon form, and the process of transforming a row echelon matrix into reduced row echelon is called Gauss-Jordan Elimination.\nThat said, the notation here is sometimes inconsistent.\nSeveral authors use the term Gaussian Elimination to include Gauss-Jordan elimination as well.\nIn addition, the process of Gauss-Jordan elimination is sometimes called Back-substitution, which is also confusing because the term can also be used to mean solving a system of equations from row echelon form, without simplifying to reduced row echelon form.\nFor this reason, we will be using the following definitions in this chapter:\n\nGaussian Elimination: The process of transforming a matrix into row echelon form\nGauss-Jordan Elimination: The process of transforming a row echelon matrix into reduced row echelon form\nBack-substitution: The process of directly solving a row echelon matrix, without transforming into reduced row echelon form\n\nThe Method\nHere I should point out that Gaussian elimination makes sense from a purely analytical point of view.\nFor small systems of equations, it's relatively straightforward to do this method by hand; however, for large systems, this (of course) become tedious and we will need to find an appropriate numerical solution.\nFor this reason, I have split this section into two parts. One will cover the analytical framework, and the other will cover an algorithm you can write in your favorite programming language.\nIn the end, reducing large systems of equations boils down to a game you play on a seemingly random matrix where you have the following moves available:\n\nYou can swap any two rows\nYou can multiply any row by a non-zero scale value\nYou can add any row to a multiple of any other row\n\nThat's it.\nBefore continuing, I suggest you try to recreate the row echelon matrix we made above.\nThat is, do the following:\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n3 & -4 & 0 & 10\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 11 & 18\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nThere are plenty of different strategies you could use to do this, and no one strategy is better than the rest.\nPersonally, I usually try to multiply each row in the matrix by different values and add rows together until the first column is all the same value, and then I subtract the first row from all subsequent rows.\nI then do the same thing for the following columns.\nAfter you get an upper triangular matrix, the next step is diagonalizing to create the reduced row echelon form. In other words, we do the following:\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 11 & 18\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{18}{11} \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{-14}{11} \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & \\frac{18}{11}\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nHere, the idea is similar to above.\nThe strategy is the same as before, but starts from the right-most column and subtracts upwards instead of downwards.\nThe Algorithm\nNow, the analytical method may seem straightforward, but the algorithm does not obviously follow from the game we were playing before, so we'll go through it step-by-step.\nIn general, do the following process:\n\nFor each column col, find the highest value\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n\\mathbf{3} & -4 & 0 & 10\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nIf that value is 0, the matrix is singular and the system has no solutions.\nFeel free to exit here, but if we want to be as general as possible the algorithm can continue even in that case.\n\nSwap the row with the highest valued element with the current row.\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n\\mathbf{2} & \\mathbf{3}  & \\mathbf{4} & \\mathbf{6} \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n\\mathbf{3} & \\mathbf{-4} & \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{10}\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\rightarrow\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n\\mathbf{3} & \\mathbf{-4} & \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{10} \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n\\mathbf{2} & \\mathbf{3}  & \\mathbf{4} & \\mathbf{6}\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\n\nFor all remaining rows, find a fraction that corresponds to the ratio of the lower value in that column to the central pivot (the one you swapped to the top)\n\n\\rightarrow\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n3 & -4 & 0 & 10 \\\\\n\\mathbf{1} & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6\n\\end{array}\n\\right] \\\\\n\\begin{align}\n    f &= A(\\text{pivot}_{\\text{row}}, \\text{pivot}_{\\text{col}}) / A(\\text{curr_row}_{\\text{row}}, \\text{pivot}_{\\text{col}}) \\\\\n      &= \\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{align}\n\nSet all values in the corresponding rows to be the value they were before - the top row \\times the fraction. This is essentially performing move 3 from above, except with an optimal multiplicative factor.\n\nA(\\text{curr_row}_{\\text{row}}, \\text{curr_col}_{\\text{col}}) \\mathrel{+}= A(\\text{pivot_row}_{\\text{row}}, \\text{pivot_row}_{\\text{curr_col}} \\times f) \\\\\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n3 & -4 & 0 & 10 \\\\\n\\mathbf{1} & \\mathbf{2} & \\mathbf{3} & \\mathbf{4} \\\\\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\rightarrow\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n3 & -4 & 0 & 10 \\\\\n\\mathbf{\\frac{1}{3}} & \\mathbf{\\frac{2}{3}} & \\mathbf{1} & \\mathbf{\\frac{4}{3}} \\\\\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nSet the value of that row's pivot column to 0.\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n3 & -4 & 0 & 10 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\n\n\nIn code, this looks like:\nfunction gaussian_elimination(A::Array{Float64,2})\n\n    rows = size(A,1)\n    cols = size(A,2)\n\n    # Row index\n    row = 1\n\n    # Main loop going through all columns\n    for col = 1:(cols-1)\n\n        # Step 1: finding the maximum element for each column\n        max_index = indmax(abs.(A[row:end,col])) + row-1\n\n        # Check to make sure matrix is good!\n        if (A[max_index, col] == 0)\n            println(\"matrix is singular!\")\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # Step 2: swap row with highest value for that column to the top\n        temp_vector = A[max_index, :]\n        A[max_index, :] = A[row, :]\n        A[row, :] = temp_vector\n\n        # Loop for all remaining rows\n        for i = (row+1):rows\n\n            # Step 3: finding fraction\n            fraction = A[i,col]/A[row,col]\n\n            # loop through all columns for that row\n            for j = (col+1):cols\n\n                 # Step 4: re-evaluate each element\n                 A[i,j] -= A[row,j]*fraction\n\n            end\n\n            # Step 5: Set lower elements to 0\n            A[i,col] = 0\n        end\n        row += 1\n    end\nend\n\nvoid gaussian_elimination(double *a, const size_t rows, const size_t cols) {\n    size_t min_dim = (rows  fabs(a[pivot * cols + k])) {\n                pivot = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (a[pivot * cols + k] == 0) {\n            printf(\"The matrix is singular.\\n\");\n            exit(0);\n        }\n\n        if (k != pivot) {\n            swap_rows(a, k, pivot, cols);\n        }\n\n        for (size_t i = k + 1; i \nfn gaussian_elimination(a: &mut Matrix) {\n    for k in 0..min(a.cols, a.rows) {\n        // Step 1: find the maximum element for this column\n        let mut max_row = k;\n        let mut max_value = a[(k, k)].abs();\n        for row in (k + 1)..a.rows {\n            if max_value \n\n\nNow, to be clear: this algorithm creates an upper-triangular matrix.\nIn other words, it only creates a matrix in row echelon form, not  reduced row echelon form.\nIf the matrix is found to be singular during this process, the system of equations is either over or under-determined and no general solution exists.\nFor this reason, many implementations of this method will stop the moment the matrix is found to be singular.\nIn this implementation, we allowed for the more general case and opted to simply output when the matrix is singular instead.\nIf you intend to solve a system of equations, then it makes sense to stop the method the moment you know there is no general solution, so some small modification might be necessary!\nSo what do we do from here? Well, we continue further reducing the matrix; however, there are two ways to do this:\n\nReduce the matrix further into reduced row echelon form with Gauss-Jordan elimination\nSolve the system directly with back-substitution if the matrix is allows for such solutions\n\nLet's start with Gauss-Jordan Elimination and then back-substitution\nGauss-Jordan Elimination\nGauss-Jordan Elimination is precisely what we said above.\nWe basically need to find the pivot of every row and set that value to 1.\nAfterwards, we subtract upwards until all values above the pivot are 0 before moving on to the next column.\nHere it is in code:\nfunction gauss_jordan_elimination(A::Array{Float64,2})\n\n    rows = size(A,1)\n    cols = size(A,2)\n\n\n    # After this, we know what row to start on (r-1)\n    # to go back through the matrix\n    row = 1\n    for col = 1:cols-1\n        if (A[row, col] != 0)\n\n            # divide row by pivot and leaving pivot as 1\n            for i = cols:-1:col\n                A[row,i] /= A[row,col]\n            end\n\n            # subtract value from above row and set values above pivot to 0\n            for i = 1:row-1\n                for j = cols:-1:col\n                    A[i,j] -= A[i,col]*A[row,j]\n                end\n            end\n            row += 1\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nThis code does not exist yet in C, so here's Julia code (sorry for the inconvenience)\nfunction gauss_jordan_elimination(A::Array{Float64,2})\n\n    rows = size(A,1)\n    cols = size(A,2)\n\n\n    # After this, we know what row to start on (r-1)\n    # to go back through the matrix\n    row = 1\n    for col = 1:cols-1\n        if (A[row, col] != 0)\n\n            # divide row by pivot and leaving pivot as 1\n            for i = cols:-1:col\n                A[row,i] /= A[row,col]\n            end\n\n            # subtract value from above row and set values above pivot to 0\n            for i = 1:row-1\n                for j = cols:-1:col\n                    A[i,j] -= A[i,col]*A[row,j]\n                end\n            end\n            row += 1\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nThis code does not exist yet in rust, so here's Julia code (sorry for the inconvenience)\nfunction gauss_jordan_elimination(A::Array{Float64,2})\n\n    rows = size(A,1)\n    cols = size(A,2)\n\n\n    # After this, we know what row to start on (r-1)\n    # to go back through the matrix\n    row = 1\n    for col = 1:cols-1\n        if (A[row, col] != 0)\n\n            # divide row by pivot and leaving pivot as 1\n            for i = cols:-1:col\n                A[row,i] /= A[row,col]\n            end\n\n            # subtract value from above row and set values above pivot to 0\n            for i = 1:row-1\n                for j = cols:-1:col\n                    A[i,j] -= A[i,col]*A[row,j]\n                end\n            end\n            row += 1\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n\n\nBack-substitution\nThe idea of back-substitution is straightforward: we create a matrix of solutions and iteratively solve for each variable by plugging in all variables before it.\nFor example, if our matrix looks like this:\n\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n2 & 3  & 4 & 6 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 11 & 18\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\nWe can quickly solve 11z = 18 for z, and then use that to solve y + 2z = 2 for y by plugging in for z.\nAfter that, we simply need to solve 2x + 3y + 4z = 6 for x in a similar fashion.\nIn code, this involves keeping a rolling sum of all the values we substitute in like so:\nfunction back_substitution(A::Array{Float64,2})\n\n    rows = size(A,1)\n    cols = size(A,2)\n\n    # Creating the solution Vector\n    soln = Vector{Float64}(rows)\n\n    # initialize the final element\n    soln[rows] = A[rows, cols] / A[rows, cols-1]\n\n    for i = (rows - 1):-1:1\n        sum = 0.0\n        for j = rows:-1:i\n            sum += soln[j]*A[i,j]\n        end\n        soln[i] = (A[i, cols] - sum) / A[i, i]\n    end\n\n    return soln\nend\n\nvoid back_substitution(const double * const a, double * const x,\n                       const size_t rows, const size_t cols) {\n\n    for (int i = rows - 1; i >= 0; --i) {\n        double sum = 0.0;\n\n        for (size_t j = cols - 2; j > i; --j) {\n            sum += x[j] * a[i * cols + j];\n        }\n\n        x[i] = (a[i * cols + cols - 1] - sum) / a[i * cols + i];\n    }\n}\n\nfn back_substitution(a: &Matrix) -> Vec {\n    let mut soln = vec![0.0; a.rows];\n\n    soln[a.rows - 1] = a[(a.rows - 1, a.cols - 1)] / a[(a.rows - 1, a.cols - 2)];\n\n    for i in (0..a.rows - 1).rev() {\n        let mut sum = 0.0;\n        for j in (i..a.rows).rev() {\n            sum += soln[j] * a[(i, j)];\n        }\n        soln[i] = (a[(i, a.cols - 1)] - sum) / a[(i, i)];\n    }\n\n    soln\n}\n\n\n\nConclusions\nAnd with that, we have two possible ways to reduce our system of equations.\nIf we are sure our matrix is not singular and that a solution exists, it's fastest to use back-substitution to find our solution.\nIf no solution exists or we are trying to find a reduced row echelon matrix, then Gauss-Jordan elimination is best.\nAs we said at the start, the notation for Gaussian Elimination is rather ambiguous in the literature, so we are hoping that the definitions provided here are clear and consistent enough to cover all the bases.\nAs for what's next... Well, we are in for a treat! The above algorithm clearly has 3 for loops, and will thus have a complexity of \\sim O(n^3), which is abysmal! If we can reduce the matrix to a specifically tridiagonal matrix, we can actually solve the system in \\sim O(n)! How? Well, we can use an algorithm known as the Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm (TDMA) also known as the Thomas Algorithm.\nExample Code\nfunction gaussian_elimination(A::Array{Float64,2})\n\n    rows = size(A,1)\n    cols = size(A,2)\n\n    # Row index\n    row = 1\n\n    # Main loop going through all columns\n    for col = 1:(cols-1)\n\n        # Step 1: finding the maximum element for each column\n        max_index = indmax(abs.(A[row:end,col])) + row-1\n\n        # Check to make sure matrix is good!\n        if (A[max_index, col] == 0)\n            println(\"matrix is singular!\")\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # Step 2: swap row with highest value for that column to the top\n        temp_vector = A[max_index, :]\n        A[max_index, :] = A[row, :]\n        A[row, :] = temp_vector\n\n        # Loop for all remaining rows\n        for i = (row+1):rows\n\n            # Step 3: finding fraction\n            fraction = A[i,col]/A[row,col]\n\n            # loop through all columns for that row\n            for j = (col+1):cols\n\n                 # Step 4: re-evaluate each element\n                 A[i,j] -= A[row,j]*fraction\n\n            end\n\n            # Step 5: Set lower elements to 0\n            A[i,col] = 0\n        end\n        row += 1\n    end\nend\n\nfunction back_substitution(A::Array{Float64,2})\n\n    rows = size(A,1)\n    cols = size(A,2)\n\n    # Creating the solution Vector\n    soln = Vector{Float64}(rows)\n\n    # initialize the final element\n    soln[rows] = A[rows, cols] / A[rows, cols-1]\n\n    for i = (rows - 1):-1:1\n        sum = 0.0\n        for j = rows:-1:i\n            sum += soln[j]*A[i,j]\n        end\n        soln[i] = (A[i, cols] - sum) / A[i, i]\n    end\n\n    return soln\nend\n\n\nfunction gauss_jordan_elimination(A::Array{Float64,2})\n\n    rows = size(A,1)\n    cols = size(A,2)\n\n\n    # After this, we know what row to start on (r-1)\n    # to go back through the matrix\n    row = 1\n    for col = 1:cols-1\n        if (A[row, col] != 0)\n\n            # divide row by pivot and leaving pivot as 1\n            for i = cols:-1:col\n                A[row,i] /= A[row,col]\n            end\n\n            # subtract value from above row and set values above pivot to 0\n            for i = 1:row-1\n                for j = cols:-1:col\n                    A[i,j] -= A[i,col]*A[row,j]\n                end\n            end\n            row += 1\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction main()\n    A = [2. 3 4 6;\n         1 2 3 4;\n         3 -4 0 10]\n\n    gaussian_elimination(A)\n    println(A)\n\n    gauss_jordan_elimination(A)\n    println(A)\n\n    soln = back_substitution(A)\n    println(soln)\n\nend\n\nmain()\n\n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nvoid swap_rows(double * const a, size_t i, size_t pivot, size_t cols) {\n    for (size_t j = 0;

Jarvis in 1973 [1].\nThough other convex hull algorithms exist, this algorithm is often called the gift-wrapping algorithm.\nThe idea behind this algorithm is simple.\nIf we start with a random distribution of points, we can find the convex hull by first starting with the left-most point and using the origin to calculate an angle between every other point in the simulation.\nAs a note, the \"angle\" can be roughly approximated with a cross-product or a dot product, which is common for some implementations here.\nWhichever point has the largest interior angle is chosen as the next point in the convex hull and we draw a line between the two points.\nFrom there, we use the two known points to again calculate the angle between all other points in the simulation.\nWe then choose the point with the largest interior angle and move the simulation forward.\nWe keep repeating this process until we have returned to our original point.\nThe set of points chosen in this simulation will be the convex hull.\nAs we might expect, this algorithm is not incredibly efficient and has a runtime of \\mathcal{O}(nh), where n is the number of points and h is the size of the hull.\nAs a note, the Jarvis March can be generalized to higher dimensions.\nSince this algorithm, there have been many other algorithms that have advanced the field of two-dimensional gift-wrapping forward, including the Graham Scan and Chan's Algorithm, which will be discussed in due time.\nBibliography\n1Jarvis, Ray A, On the identification of the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane, Elsevier, 1973.\nExample Code\nJarvisMarch.cs\n// submitted by Julian Schacher (jspp) with great help by gustorn\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\n\nnamespace JarvisMarch\n{\n    public struct Vector\n    {\n        public readonly int x;\n        public readonly int y;\n\n        public Vector(int xValue, int yValue)\n        {\n            this.x = xValue;\n            this.y = yValue;\n        }\n\n        public override bool Equals(object obj) => obj is Vector v && this.x == v.x && this.y == v.y;\n        public override int GetHashCode() => (17 * 23 + this.x) * 23 + this.y;\n\n        public static bool operator==(Vector a, Vector b) => a.Equals(b);\n        public static bool operator!=(Vector a, Vector b) => !(a == b);\n    }\n\n    public class JarvisMarch\n    {\n        public List Run(List points)\n        {\n            var convexHull = new List();\n\n            // Set the intial pointOnHull to the point of the list, where the x-position is the lowest.\n            var pointOnHull = points.Aggregate((leftmost, current) => leftmost.x \n                {\n                    // Returns true, if potentialNextPointOnHull is equal to the current pointOnHull or if the current point is left of the line defined by pointOnHull and potentialNextPointOnHull.\n                    if (potentialNextPointOnHull == pointOnHull || IsLeftOf(pointOnHull, potentialNextPointOnHull, current))\n                        return current;\n                    return potentialNextPointOnHull;\n                });\n\n                // Check if the gift wrap is completed.\n            } while (pointOnHull != convexHull[0]);\n\n            return convexHull;\n        }\n\n        // Returns true, if p is left of the line defined by a and b.\n        private bool IsLeftOf(Vector a, Vector b, Vector p) => (b.x -

L. Graham was also developing an algorithm to find the convex hull of a random set of points [1].\nUnlike the Jarvis March, which is an \\mathcal{O}(nh) operation, the Graham Scan is \\mathcal{O}(n\\log(n)), where n is the number of points and h is the size fo the hull.\nThis means that the complexity of the Graham Scan is not output-sensitive; moreover, there are some cases where the Jarvis March is more optimal, depending on the size of the hull and the number of points to wrap.\nRather than starting at the leftmost point like the Jarvis March, the Graham scan starts at the bottom.\nWe then sort the distribution of points based on the angle between the bottom-most point, the origin, and each other point.\nAfter sorting, we go through point-by-point, searching for points that are on the convex hull and throwing out any other points.\nWe do this by looking for counter-clockwise rotations.\nIf an angle between three points turns inward, the shape is obviously not convex, so we can throw that result out.\nWe can find whether a rotation is counter-clockwise with trigonometric functions or by using a cross-product, like so:\nfunction ccw(a::Point, b::Point, c::Point)\n    return ((b.x - a.x)*(c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y)*(c.x - a.x))\nend\n\nccw :: Point -> Point -> Point -> Double\nccw (xa, ya) (xb, yb) (xc, yc) = (xb - xa) * (yc - ya) - (yb - ya) * (xc - xa)\n\ndouble ccw(struct point a, struct point b, struct point c) {\n    return (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y) * (c.x - a.x);\n}\n\nfunction ccw(a, b, c) {\n  return (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - a.y) - (c.x - a.x) * (b.y - a.y);\n}\n\n#Is the turn counter clockwise?\ndef counter_clockwise(p1, p2, p3):\n    return (p3[1]-p1[1])*(p2[0]-p1[0]) >= (p2[1]-p1[1])*(p3[0]-p1[0])\n\n\n\nIf the output of this function is 0, the points are collinear.\nIf the output is positive, then the points form a counter-clockwise \"left\" turn.\nIf the output is negative, then the points form a clockwise \"right\" turn.\nWe basically do not want clockwise rotations, because this means we are at an interior angle.\n\nTo save memory and expensive append() operations, we ultimately look for points that should be on the hull and swap them with the first elements in the array.\nIf there are M elements on the hull, then the first M elements in our output random distribution of points will be the hull.\nIn the end, the code should look something like this:\nfunction graham_scan(points::Vector{Point})\n    N = length(points)\n\n    # Place the lowest point at the start of the array\n    sort!(points, by = item -> item.y)\n\n    # Sort all other points according to angle with that point\n    other_points = sort(points[2:end], by = item -> atan2(item.y - points[1].y,\n

Makes a Fourier Transform Fast?\nIf there were ever an algorithm to radically change the landscape of computer science and engineering by making seemingly impossible problems possible, it would be the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\nOn the surface, the algorithm seems like a simple application of recursion, and in principle, that is exactly what it is; however, the Fourier Transform is no ordinary transform -- it allows researchers and engineers to easily bounce back and forth between real space and frequency space and is the heart of many physics and engineering applications.\nFrom calculating superfluid vortex positions to super-resolution imaging, Fourier Transforms lay at the heart of many scientific disciplines and are essential to many algorithms we will cover later in this book.\nSimply put, the Fourier Transform is a beautiful application of complex number systems; however, it would rarely be used today if not for the ability to quickly perform the operation with Fast Fourier Transform, first introduced by the great Frederick Gauss in 1805 and later independently discovered by James Cooley and John Tukey in 1965 [1].\nGauss (of course) already had too many things named after him and Cooley and Tukey both had cooler names, so the most common algorithm for FFT's today is known as the Cooley-Tukey algorithm.\nWhat is a Fourier Transform?\nTo an outsider, the Fourier Transform looks like a mathematical mess -- certainly a far cry from the heroic portal between two domains I have depicted it to be; however, like most things, it's not as bad as it initially appears to be.\nSo, here it is in all it's glory!\nF(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty} ^\\infty f(x) e^{-2 \\pi i x \\xi} dx\nand\nf(x) = \\int_{-\\infty} ^\\infty F(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d\\xi\nWhere F(\\xi) represents a function in frequency space, \\xi represents a value in frequency space, f(x) represents a function in real space, and x represents a value in the real space.\nNote here that the only difference between the two exponential terms is a minus sign in the transformation to frequency space.\nAs I mentioned, this is not intuitive syntax, so please allow me to explain a bit.\nFirstly, what does the Fourier Transform do?\nIf we take a sum sinusoidal functions (like \\sin(\\omega t) or \\cos(\\omega t)), we might find a complicated mess of waves between \\pm 1.\nEach constituent wave can be described by only one value: \\omega.\nSo, instead of representing these curves as seen above, we could instead describe them as peaks in frequency space, as shown below.\n\n    \n\n\nThis is what the Fourier Transform does!\nAfter performing the transform, it is now much, much easier to understand precisely which frequencies are in our waveform, which is essential to most areas of signal processing.\nNow, how does this relate to the transformations above?\nWell, the easiest way is to substitute in the Euler's formula:\ne^{2 \\pi i \\theta} = \\cos(2 \\pi \\theta) + i \\sin(2 \\pi \\theta)\nThis clearly turns our function in frequency space into:\nF(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty} ^\\infty f(x) (\\cos(-2 \\pi x \\xi) + i \\sin(-2 \\pi x \\xi))dx\nand our function in real space into:\nf(x) = \\int_{-\\infty} ^\\infty F(\\xi) (\\cos(2 \\pi \\xi x) + i \\sin(2 \\pi \\xi x)) d\\xi\nHere, the \\sin and \\cos functions are clearly written in the formulas, so it looks much friendlier, right?\nThis means that a point in real space is defined by the integral over all space of it's corresponding frequency function multiplied by sinusoidal oscillations.\nTruth be told, even after seeing this math, I still didn't understand Fourier Transforms.\nTruth be told, I didn't understand it fully until I discretized real and frequency space to create the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which is the only way to implement Fourier Transforms in code.\nWhat is a Discrete Fourier Transform?\nIn principle, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is simply the Fourier transform with summations instead of integrals:\nX_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \\cdot e^{-2 \\pi i k n / N}\nand\nx_n = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k \\cdot e^{2 \\pi i k n / N}\nWhere X_n and x_n are sequences of N numbers in frequency and real space, respectively.\nIn principle, this is no easier to understand than the previous case!\nFor some reason, though, putting code to this transformation really helped me figure out what was actually going on.\nfunction DFT(x)\n    N = length(x)\n\n    # We want two vectors here for real space (n) and frequency space (k)\n    n = 0:N-1\n    k = n'\n    transform_matrix = exp.(-2im*pi*n*k/N)\n    return transform_matrix*x\n\nend\n\nvoid dft(double complex *X, const size_t N) {\n    double complex tmp[N];\n    for (size_t i = 0; i \nfunction DFT(x)\n    N = length(x)\n\n    # We want two vectors here for real space (n) and frequency space (k)\n    n = 0:N-1\n    k = n'\n    transform_matrix = exp.(-2im*pi*n*k/N)\n    return transform_matrix*x\n\nend\n\nfunction DFT(x)\n    N = length(x)\n\n    # We want two vectors here for real space (n) and frequency space (k)\n    n = 0:N-1\n    k = n'\n    transform_matrix = exp.(-2im*pi*n*k/N)\n    return transform_matrix*x\n\nend\n\nfunction DFT(x)\n    N = length(x)\n\n    # We want two vectors here for real space (n) and frequency space (k)\n    n = 0:N-1\n    k = n'\n    transform_matrix = exp.(-2im*pi*n*k/N)\n    return transform_matrix*x\n\nend\n\nfunction DFT(x)\n    N = length(x)\n\n    # We want two vectors here for real space (n) and frequency space (k)\n    n = 0:N-1\n    k = n'\n    transform_matrix = exp.(-2im*pi*n*k/N)\n    return transform_matrix*x\n\nend\n\n\n\nIn this function, we define n to be a set of integers from 0 \\rightarrow N-1 and arrange them to be a column.\nWe then set k to be the same thing, but in a row.\nThis means that when we multiply them together, we get a matrix, but not just any matrix!\nThis matrix is the heart to the transformation itself!\nM = [1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im           1.0+0.0im          1.0+0.0im;\n     1.0+0.0im  6.12323e-17-1.0im  -1.0-1.22465e-16im -1.83697e-16+1.0im;\n     1.0+0.0im

was: an actual transformation matrix!\nThat said, the Discrete Fourier Transform is slow -- primarily because matrix multiplication is slow, and as mentioned before, slow code is not particularly useful.\nSo what was the trick that everyone used to go from a Discrete fourier Transform to a Fast Fourier Transform?\nRecursion!\nThe Cooley-Tukey Algorithm\nThe problem with using a standard DFT is that it requires a large matrix multiplications and sums over all elements, which are prohibitively complex operations.\nThe Cooley-Tukey algorithm calculates the DFT directly with fewer summations and without matrix multiplications.\nIf necessary, DFT's can still be calculated directly at the early stages of the FFT calculation.\nThe trick to the Cooley-Tukey algorithm is recursion.\nIn particular, we split the matrix we wish to perform the FFT on into two parts: one for all elements with even indices and another for all odd indices.\nWe then proceed to split the array again and again until we have a manageable array size to perform a DFT (or similar FFT) on.\nWe can also perform a similar re-ordering by using a bit reversal scheme, where we output each array index's integer value in binary and flip it to find the new location of that element.\nWith recursion, we can reduce the complexity to \\sim \\mathcal{O}(n \\log n), which is a feasible operation.\nIn the end, the code looks like:\nfunction cooley_tukey(x)\n    N = length(x)\n\n    if (N > 2)\n        x_odd = cooley_tukey(x[1:2:N])\n        x_even = cooley_tukey(x[2:2:N])\n    else\n        x_odd = x[1]\n        x_even = x[2]\n    end\n    n = 0:N-1\n    half = div(N,2)\n    factor = exp.(-2im*pi*n/N)\n    return vcat(x_odd + x_even .* factor[1:half],\n                x_odd - x_even .* factor[1:half])\n\nend\n\nvoid cooley_tukey(double complex *X, const size_t N) {\n    if (N >= 2) {\n        double complex tmp [N / 2];\n        for (size_t i = 0; i \ntemplate \nvoid

factor[1:half],\n                x_odd - x_even .* factor[1:half])\n\nend\n\n\n\nAs a side note, we are enforcing that the array must be a power of 2 for the operation to work.\nThis is a limitation of the fact that we are using recursion and dividing the array in 2 every time; however, if your array is not a power of 2, you can simply pad the leftover space with 0's until your array is a power of 2.\nThe above method is a perfectly valid FFT; however, it is missing the pictorial heart and soul of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm: Butterfly Diagrams.\nButterfly Diagrams\nButterfly Diagrams show where each element in the array goes before, during, and after the FFT.\nAs mentioned, the FFT must perform a DFT.\nThis means that even though we need to be careful about how we add elements together, we are still ultimately performing the following operation:\nX_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \\cdot e^{-2 \\pi i k n / N}\nHowever, after shuffling the initial array (by bit reversing or recursive subdivision), we perform the matrix multiplication of the e^{-2 \\pi k n / N} terms in pieces.\nBasically, we split the array into a series of omega values:\n\\omega_N^k = e^{-2 \\pi i k / N}\nAnd at each step, we use the appropriate term.\nFor example, imagine we need to perform an FFT of an array of only 2 elements.\nWe can represent this addition with the following (radix-2) butterfly:\n\n    \n\n\nHere, the diagram means the following:\n\nb_0 = a_0 + \\omega_2^0 a_1 \\\\\n\nb_1 = a_0 + \\omega_2^1 a_1\n\nHowever, it turns out that the second half of our array of \\omega values is always the negative of the first half, so \\omega_2^0 = -\\omega_2^1, so we can use the following butterfly diagram:\n\n    \n\n\nWith the following equations:\n\nb_0 = a_0 + \\omega_2^0 a_1 \\\\\n\nb_1 = a_0 - \\omega_2^0 a_1\n\nBy swapping out the second \\omega value in this way, we can save a good amount of space.\nNow imagine we need to combine more elements.\nIn this case, we start with simple butterflies, as shown above, and then sum butterflies of butterflies.\nFor example, if we have 8 elements, this might look like this:\n\n    \n\n\nNote that we can perform a DFT directly before using any butterflies, if we so desire, but we need to be careful with how we shuffle our array if that's the case.\nIn the code snippet provided in the previous section, the subdivision was performed in the same function as the concatenation, so the ordering was always correct; however, if we were to re-order with bit-reversal, this might not be the case.\nFor example, take a look at the ordering of FFT (found on wikipedia) that performs the DFT shortcut:\n\n    \n\n\nHere, the ordering of the array was simply divided into even and odd elements once, but they did not recursively divide the arrays of even and odd elements again because they knew they would perform a DFT soon thereafter.\nUltimately, that's all I want to say about Fourier Transforms for now, but this chapter still needs a good amount of work!\nI'll definitely come back to this at some point, so let me know what you liked and didn't like and we can go from there!\nBibliography\n1Cooley, James W and Tukey, John W, An algorithm for the machine calculation of complex Fourier series, JSTOR, 1965.\nExample Code\nTo be clear, the example code this time will be complicated and requires the following functions:\n\nAn FFT library (either in-built or something like FFTW)\nAn approximation function to tell if two arrays are similar\n\nAs mentioned in the text, the Cooley-Tukey algorithm may be implemented either recursively or non-recursively, with the recursive method being much easier to implement.\nI would ask that you implement either the recursive or non-recursive methods (or both, if

Problems","keywords":"","body":"Decision Problems\nI'll be honest here: I am not sure what section to put these problems in, so for now, they are in Computational Mathematics, but that may change in the near future.\nI'm also not sure whether we can classify these problems as decision problems at all; however, everything in this section is related to making informed decisions when assigning inputs to appropriate outputs.\nFor example, the Hungarian algorithm reads in a bunch of inputs (candidates for certain jobs or positions) and assigns each input to an output task while minimizing the cost associated with all inputs performing their designated task.\nOverall, these problems come up all over the place and are certainly worth studying in their own

Marriage Problem","keywords":"","body":"The Stable Marriage Problem\nImagine you have two groups, each of size n.\nEach individual within a group has an internal ranking associated with all members of the opposing group.\nThe Stable Matching Problem attempts to unite both groups into stable pairs.\nIn this case, a set of pairs is considered stable if there are no pairs that like each other more than their current partners.\nThis doesn't mean that everyone gets their top choices, but if an individual prefers someone else who also prefers them back, the set of pairs is not stable.\nNow, this is often told as a story.\nOne group is male, the other is female, and everyone gets married, hence the name the Stable Marriage Problem.\nThis problem is solved by the Gale-Shapley algorithm, which can be simply described as follows:\n\nAll the men propose to their top choice of women.\nThe women become tentatively engaged to their top choice of the men who have proposed to them.\nAll rejected men propose to their next choice, and the women again select whichever man they prefer, possibly rejecting the one they were already engaged to.\n\nThis process continues until all individuals are paired, which means that this algorithm guarantees stable matching and also has a \\mathcal{O}(n^2) runtime.\nTo be clear, even though this algorithm seems conceptually simple, it is rather tricky to implement correctly.\nI do not at all claim that the code provided here is efficient and we will definitely be coming back to this problem in the future when we have more tools under our belt.\nI am incredibly interested to see what you guys do and how you implement the algorithm.\nExample Code\n# Submitted by Gustorn\n\nconst mnames = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"]\nconst wnames = [\"E\", \"F\",

Well, as mentioned, we can think of this similarly to the kinematic equation:\n\nx = x_0 + vt + \\frac{1}{2}at^2\n\nwhere x is position, v is velocity, and a is acceleration.\nThis equation allows us to find the position of an object based on it's previous position (x_0), the derivative of it's position with respect to time (\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_0) and one derivative on top of that (\\frac{d^2x}{dx^2} = a).\nAs stated in the Tayor Series Expansion, the acceleration term must also have \\frac{1}{2!} in front of it.\nNow, how does this relate to the Euler methods?\nWell, with these methods, we assume that we are looking for a position in some space, usually denoted as y(t), but we can use any variable.\nThe methods assume that we have some function to evaluate the derivative of y(t). In other words, we know that \\frac{dy(t)}{dt} = f(t,y(t)).\nFor the kinematic equation, we know what this is!\n\n\\frac{dy(t)}{dt} = v = f(t,y(t)) = v_0 + a(t)\n\nSo, we can iteratively solve for position by first solving for velocity. By following the kinematic equation (or Taylor Series Expansion), we find that\n\ny_{n+1} = y_n + f(t_n, y_n) dt\n\nFor any timestep dt. This means that if we are solving the kinematic equation, we simply have the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align}\n    x_{n+1} &= x_n + v dt \\\\\n    v_{n+1} &= a (t_n)\n\\end{align}\n\nNow, solving this set of equations in this way is known as the forward Euler Method.\nIn fact, there is another method known as the backward Euler Method, which we will get to soon enough.\nFor now, it is important to note that the error of these methods depend on the timestep chosen.\n\n    \n\n\nFor example, here we see dramatically different results for different timesteps for solving the ODE y' = \\frac{x^3}{6}, whose solution is y = \\frac{x^2}{2}.\nThe blue line is the analytical solution, the green is with a timestep of 0.5 and the red is with a timestep of 1.\nTo be clear: the larger the timestep, the worse the error becomes; however, there is at least one more problem with using the forward Euler method on real problems: instabilities.\nAs we mentioned, the forward Euler method approximates the solution to an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) by using only the first derivative.\nThis is (rather expectedly) a poor approximation.\nIn fact, the approximation is so poor that the error associated with running this algorithm can add up and result in incredibly incorrect results.\nAs you might imagine, the only solution to this is decreasing the timestep and hoping for the best or using a similar method with different stability regions, like the backward Euler method.\nLet's assume we are solving a simple ODE: y' = -3y, y(0) = 1.\nThe solution here is y(t) = e^{-3t} and we can find this solution somewhat easily with the forward Euler method shown below.\nThat said, by choosing a larger timestep, we see the Euler method's solution oscillate above and below 0, which should never happen.\nIf we were to take the Euler method's solution as valid, we would incorrectly assume that e^{-3t} will become negative!\n\n    \n\n\nLike above, the blue line is the analytical solution, the green is with a timestep of 0.5 and the red is with a tiemstep of 1.\nHere, it's interesting that we see 2 different instability patterns.\nThe green is initially unstable, but converges onto the correct solution, but the red is wrong from the get-go and only gets more wrong as time goes on.\nIn truth, the stability region of the forward Euler method for the case where y' = ky can be found with the following inequality:\n\n|kdt + 1 | \\leq 1\n\nWhich means that the forward Euler method is actually unstable for most values!\nIf we want to stick to using the forward Euler method exclusively, the only solution is to decrease the timestep until it is within this stability region, and that's not necessarily easy for all cases.\nSo now it might be obvious that another, more stable method should be used instead; however, many other stable methods are implicit, which means that in order to find the solution, we need to solve a system of equations via the Thomas Algorithm or Gaussian Elimination.\nWhich is an entire layer of complexity that most people don't want to mess with!\nNow, here is where we might want to relate the method to another algorithm that is sometimes used for a similar use-case: Verlet Integration.\nVerlet integration has a distinct advantage over the forward Euler method in both error and stability with more coarse-grained timesteps; however, Euler methods are powerful in that they may be used for cases other than simple kinematics.\nThat said, in practice, due to the instability of the forward Euler method and the error with larger timesteps, this method is rarely used in practice.\nThat said, variations of this method are certainly used (for example Crank-Nicolson and Runge-Kutta, so the time spent reading this chapter is not a total waste!\nExample Code\nLike in the case of Verlet Integration, the easiest way to test to see if this method works is to test it against a simple test-case.\nHere, the most obvious test-case would be dropping a ball from 5 meters, which is my favorite example, but proved itself to be slightly less enlightening than I would have thought.\nSo, this time, let's remove ourselves from any physics and instead solve the following ODE: y' = 5y. Note that in this case, the velocity is directly given by the ODE and the acceleration is not part of the model.\nfunction solve_euler(timestep::Float64, n::Int64)\n    euler_result = Vector{Float64}(n)\n\n    # Setting the initial condition\n    euler_result[1] = 1;\n    for i = 2:length(euler_result)\n        euler_result[i] = euler_result[i-1] -

This equation is a central equation to almost every Newtonian physics solver and brings up a class of algorithms known as force integrators. One of the first force integrators to work with is Verlet Integration.\nSo, let's say we want to solve for the next timestep in x. To a close approximation (actually performing a Taylor Series Expansion about x(t\\pm \\Delta t)), that might look like this:\n\nx(t+\\Delta t) = x(t) + v(t)\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}a(t)\\Delta t^2 + \\frac{1}{6}b(t) \\Delta t^3 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4)\n\nThis means that if we need to find the next x, we need the current x, v, a, etc. However, because few people calculate the jerk term, our error is typically \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3). That said, we can calculate x with less knowledge and higher accuracy if we play a trick! Let's say we want to calculate x of the previous timestep. Again, to a close approximation, that might look like this:\n\nx(t-\\Delta t) = x(t) - v(t)\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}a(t)\\Delta t^2 - \\frac{1}{6}b(t) \\Delta t^3 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4)\n\nNow, we have two equations to solve for two different timesteps in x, one of which we already have. If we add the two equations together and solve for x(t+\\Delta t), we find\n\nx(t+ \\Delta t) = 2x(t) - x(t-\\Delta t) + a(t)\\Delta t^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4)\n\nSo, this means, we can find our next x simply by knowing our current x, the x before that, and the acceleration! No velocity necessary! In addition, this drops the error to \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^4), which is great!\nHere is what it looks like in code:\nfunction verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n    end\n\n    return time\nend\n\ndouble verlet(double pos, double acc, double dt) {\n\n  double prev_pos = pos;\n  double time = 0;\n\n  while (pos > 0) {\n    time += dt;\n    double next_pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n    prev_pos = pos;\n    pos = next_pos;\n  }\n\n  return time;\n}\n\nvoid verlet(double *time, double pos, double acc, double dt) {\n    double prev_pos, temp_pos;\n    prev_pos = pos;\n    *time = 0.0;\n\n    while (pos > 0) {\n        *time += dt;\n        temp_pos = pos;\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n        prev_pos = temp_pos;\n    }\n}\n\nstatic void verlet(double pos, double acc, double dt){\n\n    // Note that we are using a temp variable for the previous position\n    double prev_pos, temp_pos, time;\n    prev_pos = pos;\n    time = 0;\n\n    while (pos > 0){\n        time += dt;\n        temp_pos = pos;\n        pos = pos*2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n        prev_pos = temp_pos;\n    }\n\n    System.out.println(time);\n\n}\n\ndef verlet(pos, acc, dt):\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0\n\n    while pos > 0:\n        time += dt\n        next_pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos, pos = pos, next_pos\n\nUnfortunately, this has not yet been implemented in haskell, so here's Julia code:\nfunction verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n    end\n\n    return time\nend\n\nUnfortunately, this has not yet been implemented in scratch, so here's Julia code:\nfunction verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n    end\n\n    return time\nend\n\nUnfortunately, this has not yet been implemented in matlab, so here's Julia code:\nfunction verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n    end\n\n    return time\nend\n\nUnfortunately, this has not yet been implemented in LabVIEW, so here's Julia code:\nfunction verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n    end\n\n    return time\nend\n\nfunction verlet(pos, acc, dt){\n\n    var prev_pos, temp_pos, time;\n    prev_pos = pos;\n    time = 0;\n\n    while (pos > 0){\n        time += dt;\n        temp_pos = pos;\n        pos = pos*2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n        prev_pos = temp_pos;\n    }\n\n   return time;\n\n}\n\nfn verlet(mut pos: f64, acc: f64, dt: f64) {\n    let mut prev_pos = pos;\n    let mut time = 0.0;\n\n    while pos > 0.0 {\n        time += dt;\n        let temp_pos = pos;\n        pos = pos * 2.0 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n        prev_pos = temp_pos;\n    }\n\n    println!(\"{}\", time);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, obviously this poses a problem, what if we want to calculate a term that requires velocity, like the kinetic energy, \\frac{1}{2}mv^2? In this case, we certainly cannot get rid of the velocity! Well, we can find the velocity to \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2) accuracy by using the Stormer-Verlet method, which is the same as before, but we calculate velocity like so\n\nv(t) = \\frac{x(t+\\Delta t) - x(t-\\Delta t)}{2\\Delta t} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)\n\nNote that the 2 in the denominator appears because we are going over 2 timesteps. It's essentially solving v=\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}. In addition, we can calculate the velocity of the next timestep like so\n\nv(t+\\Delta t) = \\frac{x(t+\\Delta t) - x(t)}{\\Delta t} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)\n\nHowever, the error for this is \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t), which is quite poor, but get's the job done in a pinch.\nHere's what it looks like in code:\nfunction stormer_verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n    vel = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0.0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n\n        # Because acceleration is constant, velocity is straightforward\n        vel += acc*dt\n    end\n\n    return time, vel\nend\n\ndouble stormer_verlet(double pos, double acc, double dt) {\n\n  double prev_pos = pos;\n  double time = 0;\n  double vel = 0;\n  while (pos > 0) {\n    time += dt;\n    double next_pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n    prev_pos = pos;\n    pos = next_pos;\n\n    // The acceleration is constant, so the velocity is straightforward\n    vel += acc * dt;\n  }\n\n  return time;\n}\n\nvoid stormer_verlet(double *time, double *vel,\n                    double pos, double acc, double dt) {\n    double prev_pos, temp_pos;\n    prev_pos = pos;\n    *vel = 0.0;\n    *time = 0.0;\n\n    while (pos > 0) {\n        *time += dt;\n        temp_pos = pos;\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n        prev_pos = temp_pos;\n\n        *vel += acc * dt;\n    }\n}\n\nstatic void stormer_verlet(double pos, double acc, double dt){\n\n    // Note that we are using a temp variable for the previous position\n    double prev_pos, temp_pos, time, vel;\n    prev_pos = pos;\n    vel = 0;\n    time = 0;\n    while (pos > 0){\n        time += dt;\n        temp_pos = pos;\n        pos = pos*2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n        prev_pos = temp_pos;\n\n       // The acceleration is constant, so the velocity is straightforward\n       vel += acc*dt;\n    }\n\n    System.out.println(time);\n\n}\n\n\ndef stormer_verlet(pos, acc, dt):\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0\n    vel = 0\n\n    while pos > 0:\n        time += dt\n        next_pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos, pos = pos, next_pos\n        vel += acc * dt\n\nUnfortunately, this has not yet been implemented in scratch, so here's Julia code:\nfunction stormer_verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n    vel = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0.0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n\n        # Because acceleration is constant, velocity is straightforward\n        vel += acc*dt\n    end\n\n    return time, vel\nend\n\nUnfortunately, this has not yet been implemented in scratch, so here's Julia code:\nfunction stormer_verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n    vel = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0.0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n\n        # Because acceleration is constant, velocity is straightforward\n        vel += acc*dt\n    end\n\n    return time, vel\nend\n\nUnfortunately, this has not yet been implemented in matlab, so here's Julia code:\nfunction stormer_verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n    vel = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0.0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n\n        # Because acceleration is constant, velocity is straightforward\n        vel += acc*dt\n    end\n\n    return time, vel\nend\n\nUnfortunately, this has not yet been implemented in LabVIEW, so here's Julia code:\nfunction stormer_verlet(pos::Float64, acc::Float64, dt::Float64)\n    prev_pos = pos\n    time = 0.0\n    vel = 0.0\n\n    while (pos > 0.0)\n        time += dt\n        temp_pos = pos\n        pos = pos * 2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt\n        prev_pos = temp_pos\n\n        # Because acceleration is constant, velocity is straightforward\n        vel += acc*dt\n    end\n\n    return time, vel\nend\n\nfunction stormer_verlet(pos, acc, dt){\n\n    var prev_pos, temp_pos, time, vel;\n    prev_pos = pos;\n    vel = 0;\n    time = 0;\n    while (pos > 0){\n        time += dt;\n        temp_pos = pos;\n        pos = pos*2 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n        prev_pos = temp_pos;\n\n        vel += acc*dt;\n    }\n\n   return time;\n\n}\n\nfn stormer_verlet(mut pos: f64, acc: f64, dt: f64) {\n    let mut prev_pos = pos;\n    let mut time = 0.0;\n\n    while pos > 0.0 {\n        time += dt;\n        let temp_pos = pos;\n        pos = pos * 2.0 - prev_pos + acc * dt * dt;\n        prev_pos = temp_pos;\n    }\n\n    println!(\"{}\", time);\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's say we actually need the velocity to calculate out next timestep.

Why are we simulating quantum systems on classical computers? Why not simulate it with some sort of experiment or with quantum computers?\"\nWell, here's where the notation get's really sticky.\nThere is a clear difference between quantum computers and quantum simulators.\nA quantum computer is the quantum analog to a classical computer, replacing bits with qubits by using quantum information theory.\nQuantum computers are usually thought of as a way to use quantum mechanics to eventually solve real-world problems with new quantum algorithms.\nBoth Grover's and Shor's algorithms are good examples of cases where quantum computation could greatly change the landscape of modern computation as we know it!\nQuantum simulators on the other hand are quantum systems used to better understand quantum mechanics.\nThese will often come in the form of experimental quantum systems that express quantum behaviour and allow us to better understand other areas of quantum systems.\nIn other words, quantum simulators are general techniques to study quantum systems on quantum hardware; however, quantum computers are quantum hardware used for the explicit purpose of quantum computation with qubits.\nBecause supercomputers are not great at performing quantum computations, certain quantum simulators exist as a building block for quantum computation.\nA universal quantum simulator is often called a quantum computer for this reason.\nThe truth is that quantum simulators are hard to make in laboratories, so simulating quantum systems on classical hardware is as good as we can do in most cases.\nThis section is devoted to all the different methods currently used to solve complex quantum systems, so let's start with the Schrﾃｶdinger Equation, which has many different formulations.\nHere is the easiest one to explain:\n\ni \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} = \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r},t) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\n\nWhere \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) is a quantum wavefunction, V(\\mathbf{r},t) is a trapping potential, \\nabla^2 is a laplacian, \\mathbf{r} is some sort of spatial component, and t is time.\nThere is a lot to take in here; however, it's ultimately just some time derivative on the left-hand side and a spatial derivative (with some extra steps) on the right-hand side.\nIn this way, it isn't too different from the diffusion (heat) equation:\n\n\\frac{\\partial\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)\n\nwhere D is some positive definite matrix and \\phi(\\mathbf{r},t) is the density (or temperature) of the system.\nIn fact, this is why one of the most common types of quantum simulation is sometimes called  diffusion monte carlo.\nThere really isn't that much of a difference between the two systems in terms of how they are simulated on classical hardware... but we are getting ahead of ourselves.\nFor now, let's talk about how quantum mechanics differs from classical mechanics and how we can use this to our advantage.\nProbability Density\nQuantum mechanics works fundamentally differently than classical mechanics in physics.\nThe wavefunction can be thought of as a set of all possible states for an object to be in, where there is some probability for the particle to be found in each state.\nThis means that it is not possible to say that a particle is at a particular location, and instead we often say that it could be at any location with probability, as shown in the probability density:\n\nP(\\mathbf{r}, t) = |\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)|^2 = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)^{*}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\n\nHere, there are 2 things to note:\n\nThe absolute value squared of a complex parameter \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) is a dot product (inner product) between a complex function and it's Hermitian conjugate. This means the value will always be real, while the wavefunction, itself, might not be.\nAs you have probably heard, once a wavefunction is observed it collapses onto a single state. This can be simply interpreted as absolute knowledge of the particle's location. A probability density doesn't make sense if we know where the particle is!\n\nNow, to be clear: the probabilities must all sum to 1, or (more formally):\n\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}|\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)|^2 d\\mathbf{r} = 1\n\nThis simply means that the probability of finding our quantum particle somewhere in real space is 1.\nIn other words, our particle must exist somewhere in the known universe.\nAs another note: Just like position space can be parameterized by a position vector \\textbf{x}, wavefunctions can also be parameterized by a wave vector \\textbf{k} in frequency space.\nAny wavevector \\textbf{k} has the same units as reciprocal space and is thus analogous to angular frequency \\omega.\nOften times, the wavevector space is called momentum space, which makes sense when considering the de Broglie formula:\n\np = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\pi h}{2 \\pi \\lambda} = \\hbar k\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant and \\lambda is the wavelength.\nThis means that we can ultimately move between position and momentum space by using Fourier Transforms, which is incredibly useful in a number of cases!\nEven though the relation between position and momentum space is an essential cornerstone of understanding modern quantum mechanics, it is difficult to understand at a fundamental level.\nPosition space and momentum space are related by a Fourier transform; however, the rather hand-wavey argument above might not have been convincing enough and it does not offer any intuitive description of why the Fourier transform comes into this discussion at all.\nThe easiest way to understand this might be to look at the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is a fundamental relation between position and momentum space.\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle\nSimply put, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that we cannot definitely know both the position and momentum of a quantum particle.\nIn particular, it says:\n\n\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \n\nwhere \\hbar is Planck's constant and \\sigma_q = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(q_i-\\mu)^2}.\nIn this case, \\sigma is the standard deviation, \\mu is the statistical mean of your distribution, N is the number of points sampled, q_i is the value for each point i, and q stands for r or p.\nUltimately, this means that if we have a higher precision in position space, we will have a lower precision in momentum space.\nThe converse is also true: a higher precision in momentum space will lead to a lower precision in position space.\nThis makes the most sense if we imagine having a gaussian-like probability density (|\\Psi(x)|^2) in position space, which will provide a gaussian-like density when in momentum space.\nHere, we see that if we have a broader distribution in one space, we must have a thinner distribution in the opposite space, as shown here:\n\n    \n\n\n\nBecause the density can be interpreted as \"the probability of finding a quantum particle at any provided location in position (x_i) or momentum (k_i) space, the interpretation is clear: the more we understand about a particle's position, the less we understand about it's momentum.\nThis is a powerful statement and should be given some thought.\nTo me, the most interesting part of this description is not the physical interpretation, but the fact that this act of transforming between larger and smaller gaussians is precisely what Fourier transforms do!\nThis further strengthens our argument from before.\nPosition and momentum space are related by the Fourier transform!\nThis is the heart of several algorithms for simulating quantum systems, including the Split-operator method.\nAt least for me, I found this description to be intuitive, but not complete.\nThere is still something missing from the picture that should be described in more depth, and to do that, we need to dive deeper into the heart of quantum mechanics and into Hamiltonians.\nHamiltonian\nHere is the Schrﾃｶdinger equation again:\n\ni \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} = \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r},t) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\n\nWe described it in the initial section of this chapter.\nFor the most part, when we are trying to solve this equation the left-hand side does not change.\nIt's always i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t}.\nOn the other hand, the right-hand side can change a lot depending on the situation.\nThat is to say that we can easily simplify the Schrﾃｶdinger equation by using a mathematical formalism known as the Hamiltonian.\nTo be clear, Hamiltonian mechanics is not a quantum-specific idea.\nIt's everywhere in statistical physics and is often taught in classical physics courses as an analogue to another notational form known as Lagrangian mechanics.\nFor simplicity, we will restrict our discussion here to interpreting Hamiltonians physically.\nWe can basically say that the Hamiltonian is a measure of the energy of our quantum system.\nMore specifically, we can say that the Hamiltonian is a set of energy operators that act on our wavefunction.\nIn the case of a 1D particle in a harmonic trap, we might use the following definitions:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat H &= \\hat T + \\hat V \\\\\n\\hat T &= \\frac{p^2}{2m} \\\\\n\\hat V &= \\frac{1}{2}\\omega x^2\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere p = -i\\hbar \\nabla is the momentum operator and \\omega is the trapping frequency indicating how confined our quantum system will be.\nIn this case, \\hat T is an operator that works on our wavefunction in momentum space, while \\hat V acts in position space.\nBoth of these are operators.\nThat is to say that they operate on our quantum system by transforming it in some way.\nUltimately, this means that the operators are not meant to be interpreted on their own without acting on some other object, in this case, the wavefunction \\Psi(x).\nIn the end, we can update our Schrﾃｶdinger equation to be\n\ni \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} = \\hat H \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\n\nWhich is a lot cleaner and more general.\nNow, the Schrﾃｶdinger equation can solve any quantum system so long as it can be written in terms of Hamiltonian mechanics!\nWhen looking at the operators, it is clear that the \\hat V operator is in position space.\nWe can clearly see that it operates as a function of x.\nThat said, it is not immediately obvious why the \\hat T is in momentum space.\nThis is not an easy question to answer, but it is definitely important and will be covered in more depth when we discuss spectral methods.\nFor now, we will blanketly say\n\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left( 2\\pi i k \\mathcal{F}\\left( f \\right)\\right)\n\nIn other words, we can derive a function by performing a Fourier transform on the function, multiplying by some momentum-space grid, and then inverse-transforming it back.\nBecause this operation inherently involves a transform into momentum space before transformation, it is a momentum-space operator.\nThis is the most intuitive reasoning I can find; however, I am sure there are more intuitive explanations of why the derivatives are always momentum-space operations.\nThis section will be updated further when we discuss spectral methods, but if you have better descriptions, please let me know!\nBra Ket Notation\nUnfortunately, the interpretation of quantum simulation is rather tricky and is sometimes easier to understand with slightly different notation.\nThis notation is called braket notation, where a ket looks like this:\n\n\\lvert A \\rangle\n\nand basically describes A as a column vector.\nThe bra represents the Hermitian conjucate of the ket and looks like this:\n\n\\langle B \\rvert\n\nThe ket is often represented as a row vector for B.\nBecause of this,  \\langle B \\rvert A \\rangle  represents the inner product of the two vectors and  \\lvert A \\rangle \\langle B \\rvert  represents the outer product.\nNow, to this point, the braket notation does not have any particularly quantum-like features; however, it becomes useful when describing actual quantum phenomenon.\nFor example, if we want to indicate the probability of a wavefunction \\psi collapsing onto state \\phi, we might write: \\langle \\phi \\rvert \\psi \\rangle, which is precisely the same as the probability density defined above.\nNow that we have a basic understanding of the notation, we should go through several other important quantum mechanical ideas and properties.\nEigenstates\nAs mentioned, the wavefunction \\Psi(x) is complex and has both real and imaginary parts; however, there are certain states that are eclusively real.\nThese states are eigenstates of the system, and are often described as the constituent states that make up all other possible wavefunctions.\nIn other words,\n\n\\lvert \\Psi(x)\\rangle = \\sum_i c_i \\lvert \\Psi_i \\rangle\n\nWhere c_i is some constant describing how much of a given eigenstate i is in the full wavefunction.\nAs you might expect, all of the c_i's should sum to 1.\nEnergy Calculations\nWhen it comes to quantum systems, there is no quantity more important than energy.\nBasically, every eigenstate of the system has a different energy associated with it, and you can find this energy with a simple calculation:\n\nE = \\langle \\Psi \\lvert \\hat H \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle\n\nWhich can be done rather trivially in code by finding the conjugate of the wavefunction and multiplying it with another wavefunction after operation in position and momentum space.\nThis ultimately looks like this:\n# We are calculating the energy to check \nfunction calculate_energy(wfc, H_k, H_r, dx)\n    # Creating momentum and conjugate wavefunctions\n    wfc_k = fft(wfc_r)\n    wfc_c = conj(wfc_r)\n\n    # Finding the momentum and real-space energy terms\n    energy_k = wfc_c.*ifft((H_k) .* wfc_k)\n    energy_r = wfc_c.* H_r .* wfc_r\n\n    # Integrating over all space\n    energy_final = 0\n    for i = 1:length(energy_k)\n        energy_final += real(energy_k[i] + energy_r[i])\n    end \n\n    return energy_final*dx\nend\n\n\n\nThis calculation will be used in many different simulations of quantum systems to check our results.\nIn the end, many quantum simulations are focused on the ground state, which is the lowest energy state (\\Psi_0); however, sometimes higher energy states are desired.\nThe Future\nAs we proceed to add new algorithms to simulate quantum systems, I will add more and more notation to this section; however, there are already huge textbooks out there related to understanding and studying quantum systems.\nWe don't want to re-invent the wheel here.\nInstead, we want to focus on an area that is often not considered with too much detail: algorithms and methods researchers use to ascertain new knowedge about quantum mechanics, like the split-operator method, DMRG, quantum monte carlo, exact diagonalization, and many more.\nQuantum mechanics is one of those areas of physics that really does push the boundary of human knowledge in a number of different areas and computing is one of those areas.\nIn fact, quantum information theory is currently set to be the next innovation to radically change the landscape of modern computation as we know it!\nOf course, because of the large-scale effects that this will likely have on the industry, it deserved it's own section.\nAs always, if there is something that you feel is missing from this section, please feel free to contact me or create an issue on GitHub and we'll get to it as soon as we

Method","keywords":"","body":"The Split-Operator Method\nThe Split-Operator Method (also called the Split-Step Method), was actually the primary method I used to solve the Schrﾃｶdinger equation during my PhD.\nIt is one of the simplest and fastest methods for this purpose and is widely used throughout modern quantum research in the area, in particular when dealing with the Non-linear Schrﾃｶdinger Equation (NLSE):\n\ni \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} = \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) + g|\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)|^2 \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t),\n\nwhich follows from the notation provided in the quantum systems chapter: \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) is a quantum wave-function with spatial (\\mathbf{r}) and time (t) dependence, \\nabla^2 is a laplacian, and V(\\mathbf{r}) is a potential of some sort (like \\omega x^2 or something).\nIn this case, we also add an interaction term g next to a nonlinear |\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)|^2 term.\nThis is the system I studied for most of my PhD (granted, we played a few tricks with parallelization and such, so it was slightly more complicated).\nAt its heart, the split-op method is nothing more than a pseudo-spectral differential equation solver... That is to say, it solves the Schrﾃｶdinger equation with FFT's.\nIn fact, there is a large class of spectral and pseudo-spectral methods used to solve a number of different physical systems, and we'll definitely be covering those in the future.\nAs mentioned in the quantum systems section, we can represent a quantum wavefunction in momentum space, which is parameterized with the wavevector k.\nIn the Hamiltonian shown above, we can split our system into position space components, \\hat{H}_r = \\left[V(\\mathbf{r}) + g|\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)|^2 \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t), and momentum space components, \\hat{H}_k = \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 \\right]\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t).\nI'll be honest, I didn't know what notation to use for \\hat H_r because p is used to describe momentum.\nI settled on r for real space, but that is somewhat notationally ambiguous.\nIn addition, k will indicate momentum space because it is a sum of all wavevectors, typically notated as k.\nBad notation aside, let's continue.\nIf we assume a somewhat general solution to our quantum system:\n\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t + dt) = \\left[e^{-\\frac{i\\hat{H}dt}{\\hbar}}\\right]\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\left[e^{-\\frac{i(\\hat{H}_r + \\hat{H}_k)dt}{\\hbar}}\\right]\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\n\nand assume we are simulating our system by a series of small timesteps (dt), we can perform similar splitting by using the Baker-Campbell-Housdorff formula:\n\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t+dt) = \\left[e^{-\\frac{i\\hat{H}_rdt}{\\hbar}}e^{-\\frac{i\\hat{H}_kdt}{\\hbar}}e^{-\\frac{[i\\hat{H}_r, i\\hat{H}_k]dt^2}{2}}\\right]\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\n\nThis accrues a small amount of error (dt^2) related to the commutation of the real and momentum-space components of the Hamiltonian.\nThis is a relatively large error and that's not okay.\nIn order to change the dt^2 error to dt^3, we can split the system by performing a half-step in position space before doing a full-step in momentum space, through a process called Strang Splitting like so:\n\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t+dt) = \\left[e^{-\\frac{i\\hat{H}_rdt}{2\\hbar}}e^{-\\frac{i\\hat{H}_kdt}{\\hbar}}e^{-\\frac{i\\hat{H}_rdt}{2\\hbar}} \\right]\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) + \\mathcal{O}(dt^3)\n\nWe can then address each part of this solution in chunks, first in position space, then in momentum space, then in position space again by using Fourier Transforms.\nWhich looks something like this:\n\n\\Psi(\\mathcal{r}, t+dt) = \\left[\\hat{U}_r\\left(\\frac{dt}{2}\\right)\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left[\\hat{U}_k(dt) \\mathcal{F} \\left[\\hat{U}_r\\left(\\frac{dt}{2}\\right) \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) \\right] \\right] \\right] + \\mathcal{O}(dt^3)\n\nwhere \\hat{U}_r = e^{-\\frac{i\\hat{H}_rdt}{\\hbar}}, \\hat{U}_k = e^{-\\frac{i\\hat{H}_kdt}{\\hbar}}, and \\mathcal{F} and \\mathcal{F}^{-1} indicate forward and inverse Fourier Transforms.\nHere's a flowchart of what we are looking for every timestep:\n\n    \n\n\n\nFor the most part, that's it:\n\nMultiply the wavefunction in real space with the real-space operator. \nFlip to momentum space with a Fourier transform.\nMultiply the momentum-space wavefuntion by the momentum-space operator.\nFlip to position space with an inverse Fourier transform.\nRepeat 1-4 until satisfied.\n\nIf we guess that our initial wavefunction is gaussian-like and is slightly offset from the center or the trap, this should allow us to see our wavefunction \"sloshing\" back and forth in our trap, like so:\n\n    \n\n\nAs a small concession, using this method enforces periodic boundary conditions, where the wavefunction will simply slide from one side of your simulation box to the other, but that's fine for most cases.\nIn fact, for many cases (such as large-scale turbulence models) it's ideal.\nThat said, there is more to the story.\nAs we mentioned in the quantum systems section, many simulations of quantum systems desire to find the ground state of our system.\nThe split-operator method can be used for that too!\nIf we run this simulation in imaginary time, by simply setting \\tau = it and stepping through \\tau instead of t, we will no longer see an \"real-world\" example of how the atoms should behave, but will instead see an exponential decay of higher-energy states.\nIf we run the simulation for long enough with a small enough timestep, all higher energy states will vanish.\nThis means that we can find the ground state of our system by running the simulation in imaginary time, which is an incredibly useful feature!\nIf we run the same simulation as above in imaginary time, we should see our wavefunction smoothly move to the center of our trap (the lowest energy position), like so:\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Algorithm\nLuckily, the code in this case is pretty straightforward.\nAs a note before starting, we will be using normalized units in this simulation where \\hbar = c = 1.\nThese units are often called natural units.\nMany of you (cough experimentalists cough) will probably think that these units are completely unphysical, and they are; however, they allow us to output fractions and whole numbers.\nFor example, if we are trying to find the energy of the ground state of atoms in a simple harmonic oscillator, we know it should be \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega, where \\omega is the coefficient in front of the x^2 term known as the frequency of the trap.\nIf we were to calculate the energy in real units, our simulation would output 5.272859 \\times 10^{-35}, which is hard to interpret.\nBy instead using natural units, we get precisely \\frac{1}{2} and we know that those are in units of \\hbar\\omega.\nThere is no doubt that it makes the simulation easier to understand (albeit a little misleading in the end).\nRegardless, we first need to set all the initial parameters, including the initial grids in real and momentum space:\nstruct Param\n    xmax::Float64\n    res::Int64\n    dt::Float64\n    timesteps::Int64\n    dx::Float64\n    x::Vector{Float64}\n    dk::Float64\n    k::Vector{Float64}\n    im_time::Bool\n\n    Param() = new(10.0, 512, 0.05, 1000, 2 * 10.0/512,\n                  Vector{Float64}(-10.0 + 10.0/512 : 20.0/512 : 10.0),\n                  pi / 10.0,\n                  Vector{Float64}(vcat(0:512/2 - 1, -512/2 : -1) * pi/10.0),\n                  false)\n    Param(xmax::Float64, res::Int64, dt::Float64, timesteps::Int64,\n          im_val::Bool) = new(\n              xmax, res, dt, timesteps,\n              2*xmax/res, Vector{Float64}(-xmax+xmax/res:2*xmax/res:xmax),\n              pi/xmax, Vector{Float64}(vcat(0:res/2-1, -res/2:-1)*pi/(xmax)),\n              im_val\n          )\nend\n\n\n\nAs a note, when we generate our grid in momentum space k, we need to split the grid into two lines, one that is going from 0 to -kmax and is then discontinuous and goes from kmax to 0.\nThis is simply because the FFT will naturally assume that the 0 in our grid is at the left side of the simulation, so we shift k-space to match this expectation.\nAlso, for this code we will be using the notation from above: opr.R will be the real space operators and opr.M will be the momentum space operators.\nThere is another boolean value here called im_time, which is for imaginary time evolution.\nAfterwards, we turn them into operators:\nmutable struct Operators\n    V::Vector{Complex{Float64}}\n    PE::Vector{Complex{Float64}}\n    KE::Vector{Complex{Float64}}\n    wfc::Vector{Complex{Float64}}\n\n    Operators(res) = new(Vector{Complex{Float64}}(res),\n                         Vector{Complex{Float64}}(res),\n                         Vector{Complex{Float64}}(res),\n                         Vector{Complex{Float64}}(res))\nend\n\n# Function to initialize the wfc and potential\nfunction init(par::Param, voffset::Float64, wfcoffset::Float64)\n    opr = Operators(length(par.x))\n    opr.V = 0.5 * (par.x - voffset).^2\n    opr.wfc = exp.(-(par.x - wfcoffset).^2/2)\n    if (par.im_time)\n        opr. = exp.(-0.5*par.k.^2*par.dt)\n        opr.PE = exp.(-0.5*opr.V*par.dt)\n    else\n        opr. = exp.(-im*0.5*par.k.^2*par.dt)\n        opr.PE = exp.(-im*0.5*opr.V*par.dt)\n    end\n\n    return opr\nend\n\n\n\nHere, we use a standard harmonic potential for the atoms to sit in and a gaussian distribution for an initial guess for the probability distribution.\nIf we give either the trap or the atoms a slight offset (so the gaussian distribution of atoms does not quite rest at the bottom of the x^2 potential, we can see the atoms moving back and forth in the potential as we move the simulation forward in time.\nThis means that we can easily see the dynamics of our quantum system!\nIf we run the simulation in imaginary time, we will see the gaussian distribution of atoms move towards the center of the potential, which is the location with the lowest energy.\nBoth of these have been shown in the figures above.\nThe final step is to do the iteration, itself.\nfunction split_op(par::Param, opr::Operators)\n\n    for i = 1:par.timesteps\n        # Half-step in real

A perfect day to go outside and relax!\"\nThis provides you a lot of information, and to some degree of certainty you can conclude it is summer.\nOf course, after this interaction you do not acknowledge your mother's existence after her answer and go back to coding.\nYou have the information you need.\nNo reason to overcomplicate things with further human contact.\nSee, information is defined in a number of different places for a number of different reasons, so for our purposes, we will define the unit of information to be the bit, a simple binary 1 or 0.\nTaking the example mentioned before (assuming you can take your mother at face-value), you were provided 3 true statements:\n\nIt is bright\nIt is sunny\nIt is warm\n\nWith this information, you assumed that it was probably summer.\nUnfortunately, your assumption about it being summer is not information.\nIt might be a logical conclusion, but it was not provided as a \"fact.\"\nThis is an important distinction between what we might colloquially describe as information and what information theory requires.\nInformation theory works with measurements -- binary absolutes.\nNow, we can clearly say that with some probability it is summer, but this is a different story altogether, which we will undoubtedly discuss in the future.\nFor now, let's talk about a simple representation of information on computer systems.\nImagine you have a simple alphabet with only 2 characters in it, a and b.\nIn this case, there are plenty of ways you can represent these characters in bits, but the most obvious way might look like this:\n\n\n\nCharacter\nBit Representation\n\n\n\n\na\n0\n\n\nb\n1\n\n\n\nSo long as you don't add any new characters to the mix, this is a perfectly valid set of codewords.\nIf you get the bitstring 0111101, you can easily decode it as abbbbab.\nBut what if you wanted to add a third character, c?\nWell, it's clear that c cannot be either 0 or 1, but because of the way we have defined the set of codewords above, it actually cannot be any combination of 0 or 1 either.\nFor example, if we defined c to be 01 and we were provided the bitstring 0111101, we could interpret this string as either abbbbab or cbbbc!\nNow, we could use context or other information provided to distinguish these two possible cases, but it is clear that we need to think more deeply about our set of codewords in this case.\nFirst, let's think a bit about decoding.\nFor our purposes, we do not want to think when decoding.\nNo matter what the bitstring is that we need to decode, we want to be able to read bit-by-bit until we find a match in our set of codewords and move on.\nBasically, we do not want any ambiguity in our set of codewords.\nThe code for c should not contain the code for a or b!\nIn this way, our set of codewords should be prefix-free.\nNo word should appear as a prefix to another word.\nIf we wanted a good, prefix-free set of codewords for 4 characters (a, b, c, and d), it might look like this:\n\n\n\nCharacter\nBit Representation\n\n\n\n\na\n00\n\n\nb\n01\n\n\nc\n10\n\n\nd\n11\n\n\n\nWe can decode any even bitstring with this set.\n0100101010110100 is bacccdba.\nThis is great, but now we have another question: given a string of characters, can we construct a set of codewords that minimizes the number of bits in its corresponding bitstring?\nThis is the heart of data compression!\nFirst things first, let's define a simple measure for how compressed the data is.\nLet's take the following set of characters: abbcccdddd.\nIf we were to put all the letters in a bag and pull one out at random, we would have the following probabilities of pulling out any of the letters:\n\n\n\nCharacter\nProbability\n\n\n\n\na\n.1\n\n\nb\n.2\n\n\nc\n.3\n\n\nd\n.4\n\n\n\nThis basically means that we are far more likely to pull out a d than an a, and if we are trying to minimize the length of our encoded bitstring, the length of the bit representation for d should probably be shorter than the bit representation for a.\nUltimately, to compress our encoded bitstring, we want to minimize the following quantity:\n\nL(C(W)) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n}w_i\\times \\text{length}(c_i)\n\nWhere C is the characters of our alphabet and c_i is codeword for a single character, W is related to the probability of pulling that character out of a bag and w_i is an individual probability of getting a specific character, and L is a vague, unitless quantity to determine the overall length and is usually used to determine compression ratios.\nTo show how this works, let's consider encoding the word abbcccdddd with two different alphabets:\n\n\n\nCharacter\nProbability\nBit Representation 1\nBit Representation 2\n\n\n\n\na\n.1\n00\n000\n\n\nb\n.2\n01\n001\n\n\nc\n.3\n10\n01\n\n\nd\n.4\n11\n1\n\n\n\nIn this case:\n\n\\begin{align}\nL_1 &= 0.1\\times 2 + 0.2 \\times 2 + 0.3 \\times 2 + 0.4 \\times 2 = 2 \\\\\nL_2 &= 0.1\\times 3 + 0.2 \\times 3 + 0.3 \\times 2 + 0.4 \\times 1 = 1.9\n\\end{align}\n\nHere, it's clear that L_2 , and thus the second set of codewords compresses our data more than the first.\nThis measure can be used as a direct test of certain simple data compression techniques, notably those created by Shannon, Fano, and Huffman, which will be covered soon!\n\nMathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]);\n\n\n\\newcommand{\\d}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\bff}{\\boldsymbol{f}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfg}{\\boldsymbol{g}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfp}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfq}{\\boldsymbol{q}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfx}{\\boldsymbol{x}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfu}{\\boldsymbol{u}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfv}{\\boldsymbol{v}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfA}{\\boldsymbol{A}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfB}{\\boldsymbol{B}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfC}{\\boldsymbol{C}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfM}{\\boldsymbol{M}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfJ}{\\boldsymbol{J}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfR}{\\boldsymbol{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfT}{\\boldsymbol{T}}\n\\newcommand{\\bfomega}{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}\n\\newcommand{\\bftau}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}\n\n"},"contents/huffman_encoding/huffman_encoding.html":{"url":"contents/huffman_encoding/huffman_encoding.html","title":"Huffman Encoding","keywords":"","body":"Huffman Encoding\nIf there were ever a data compression method to take the world by storm, it would be Huffman encoding.\nIn fact, this was the method that got me into computational methods to begin with.\nI distinctly remember sitting in my data compression class and talking about the great information theorist Claude Shannon and Robert Fano, when suddenly my professor introduced a new kid to the mix: David Huffman.\nHe managed to rip the heart out of the methods described by leaders of the field and create a data compression method that was easier to understand and implement, while also providing more robust results, and apparently this was all done for a school project!\nIt was in that moment, I knew I would never amount to anything.\nI have since accepted that fact and moved on.\nHuffman encoding follows from the problem described in the Data Compression section.\nWe have a string that we want to encode into bits.\nHuffman encoding ensures that our encoded bitstring is as small as possible without losing any information.\nBecause it is both lossless and guarantees the smallest possible bit length, it outright replaces both Shannon and Shannon-Fano encoding in most cases, which is a little weird because the method was devised while Huffman was taking a course from Fano, himself!\nThe idea is somewhat straightforward in principle, but a little difficult to code in practice.\nBy creating a binary tree of the input alphabet, every branch can be provided a unique bit representation simply by assigning a binary value to each child and reading to a character in a leaf node if starting from the root node.\nSo now the question is: how do we create a binary tree?\nWell, here we build it from the bottom up like so:\n\nOrder all characters according to the frequency they appear in the input bitstring, with the most frequent character at the top of the list. Be sure to keep track of the frequencies, too!\nAdd the smallest two values together to create a new node with a new frequency.\nKeep doing step 2 until the tree is complete.\nRead the tree backwards from the root node and concatenate the final bitstring codeword. Keep all codewords and put them into your final set of codewords (sometimes called a codebook)\nEncode your phrase with the codebook.\n\nAnd that's it.\nHere's an image of what this might look like for the phrase bibbity_bobbity:\n\n    \n\n\nThis will create a codebook that looks like this:\n\n\n\nCharacter\nBit Representation\n\n\n\n\nb\n0\n\n\ni\n100\n\n\nt\n101\n\n\ny\n110\n\n\no\n1110\n\n\n_\n1111\n\n\n\nand bibbity_bobbity becomes 01000010010111011110111000100101110.\nAs mentioned this uses the minimum number of bits possible for encoding.\nThe fact that this algorithm is both conceptually simple and provably useful is rather extraordinary to me and is why Huffman encoding will always hold a special place in my heart.\nExample Code\nIn code, this can be a little tricky. It requires a method to continually sort the nodes as you add more and more nodes to the system.\nThe most straightforward way to do this in some languages is with a priority queue, but depending on the language, this might be more or less appropriate.\nIn addition, to read the tree backwards, some sort of Depth First Search needs to be implemented.\nWhether you use a stack or straight-up recursion also depends on the language, but the recursive method is a little easier to understand in most cases.\n# This is for the PriorityQueue\nusing DataStructures\n\nstruct Leaf\n

Information","keywords":"","body":"Quantum Information\nQuantum information theory is... intense.\nIt requires a strong and fundamental understanding of classical information theory and quantum mechanics.\nIt is not obvious in any way and deserves many textbooks on it's own.\nIn fact, there are numerous textbooks on the subject already.\nThe purpose of this section isn't to outdo any of that fundamental knowledge.\nInstead, we will attempt to distill the knowledge into a short, intuitive summary, with the hopes of helping people to understand more about the topic and pursue it further on their own.\nAt the time of writing, true quantum computers do not exist.\nWe do have some systems that are able to simulate qubits, they are not truly universal quantum computers.\nThe closest market-ready system we currently have is D-WAVE, which boasts an impressive 128 qubits!\nThere are many places to start an introduction to quantum information theory, so we'll go through it one step at a time:\n\nQuantum bitlogic: what is a qubit and how is it different than a classical bit?\nQuantum gates and quantum circuits: How do you fundamentally build a quantum algorithm?\nQuantum computers in the wild: Current experimental techniques to create a quantum computer and what makes them ill-suited as real quantum computers\nA survey of current quantum algorithms: There are a number of algorithms that promise fantastic advantages when performed on quantum computers and should really shake up the industry when they are finally experimentally realized.\n\nAs a note, item 3 might seem out of place for a book on algorithms, and I would tend to agree; however, at this point there is a phenomenal amount of research being done to realize the first truly quantum computer and there are a number of potential systems that could work for this purpose.\nThese systems will change how we think about and interface with quantum computation in the future and it is important to discuss where the field might be heading and when we can expect quantum computers at home.\nNow, there are not too many languages that can compile quantum code.\nA while ago, we tried to make a quantum circuit compiler, which was modeled after the SPICE circuit simulator, but this was far from a computer language.\nAt this point in time, it is impossible to tell what quantum computing languages will look like when we finally have a truly quantum machine, so for the time being, we will not ask for community code for the chapters related to quantum information.\nbasically, it's hard to imagine how to would adequately implement Shor's algorithm in C.\nAs always, this section will be updated as we add more algorithms to the list.\n"}}}
